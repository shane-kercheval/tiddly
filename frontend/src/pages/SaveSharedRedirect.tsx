/**
 * In-app save route for the public "Save to Tiddly" flow (M5.1).
 *
 * Reached two ways, both of which need consent collected before the clone runs:
 * - A logged-out visitor clicks "Sign in to save" on a shared page; Auth0
 *   returns them here via `appState.returnTo` (SaveACopy's anonymous branch).
 * - A logged-in-but-unconsented user clicks Save in place; `useSavePublicItem`
 *   redirects here on the resulting 451.
 *
 * This route is registered under `AppLayout` but *outside* `Layout`, so it gets
 * AppLayout's consent enforcement (the existing `ConsentDialog`) without kicking
 * off the app shell's sidebar/filters/tags fetches. The new user reads (no auth)
 * → clicks Save → signs up → AppLayout collects consent → this route fires the
 * clone once and lands them on their new copy. No consent UI is added to the
 * public page.
