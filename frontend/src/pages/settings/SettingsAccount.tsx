/**
 * Account settings page — Clerk's <UserProfile /> mounted in-app (Settings →
 * Account), rather than linking out to the hosted Account Portal, so users
 * stay inside the app consistent with the existing settings pattern.
 *
 * New capability, not parity (migration plan M3 step 9): password change and
 * session/device management never existed under Auth0, which ships no
 * end-user account UI.
 *
 * GUARD RAIL: do NOT expose an account-deletion section until deletion is
 * wired end-to-end (Clerk `user.deleted` webhook → backend cascade delete,
 * plan M8) — a Clerk-side deletion without the webhook orphans all the user's
 * data in Postgres. Whether the section appears is controlled Clerk-side
 * ("Allow users to delete their accounts" in the instance's user settings);
 * the dev-instance pass verifies it is off (ledger question 12 records what
 * the component and the hosted portal expose).
 *
 * In dev mode there is no Clerk context or account to manage; the page says so
 * instead of rendering the component.
 *
 * This file is one of the few allowed to import the Clerk SDK (see
 * eslint.config.js): it mounts prebuilt Clerk UI, which cannot be expressed
 * through the seam.
