# tiddly.me

> tiddly.me is a content management platform for bookmarks, notes, and prompts (Jinja2 templates). It features tagging, full-text search, content versioning, and AI integration via two MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.

## What tiddly.me Does

tiddly.me helps users organize three types of content:

- **Bookmarks**: Save URLs with auto-scraped metadata (title, description, page content), personal notes, and tags. Clicking a bookmark's title or URL opens the link in a new tab; use the pencil icon to edit.
- **Notes**: Freeform markdown documents with tags. Clicking a note opens it for viewing and editing.
- **Prompts**: A new content type for the AI era, treated as first-class entities. Prompts are Jinja2 templates with named arguments and a unique `prompt_name` identifier. They support the same versioning, tagging, search, and organization as bookmarks and notes, but are purpose-built for rendering with variables and integrating with AI assistants via MCP. Clicking a prompt opens it for viewing and editing.

All content types support tagging, full-text search, content versioning with history, archiving, soft-delete with restore, relationships (linking items together), and usage tracking.

## Content Organization

### Tags
- Tags are global across all content types. A "work" tag on a bookmark and a note is the same tag.
- Renaming a tag is a global rename across all content and filters.
- Deleting a tag removes the association from all content but does not delete the content itself.
- Inactive tags are tags that exist only on archived or deleted items.

### Content Filters
- Saved filters use tag-based boolean expressions: groups of tags combined with AND within a group, OR between groups.
- Example: `(python AND tutorial) OR (javascript AND guide)` matches items tagged with both python+tutorial, or both javascript+guide.
- Filters appear in the sidebar for quick access and can be organized into collections.
- Collections are drag-and-drop groupable containers in the sidebar that hold filters, allowing users to organize them by topic or workflow.
- Deleting a filter only removes the saved view; your content is unaffected.
- Deleting a collection moves its filters back to the sidebar root — nothing is lost.

### Relationships
- Any content item can be linked to any other item (bookmark-to-note, note-to-prompt, etc.) with an optional description.
- Relationships are shown when viewing an item's detail page.

## Prompts and Templates

Prompts are Jinja2 templates that can be rendered with arguments. The primary use case is through MCP — AI assistants call the Prompt MCP Server to list, render, and manage prompt templates during conversations.

- **Template syntax**: Use `{{ variable_name }}` for template variables.
- **Arguments**: Each prompt defines arguments with a name, description, and whether they are required.
- **Rendering**: Provide argument values to render a prompt into final text. Required arguments must be supplied; optional arguments default to empty string.
- **Auto-sync**: When editing a template, arguments are automatically updated to match the template variables.
- **Skills export**: Prompts can be exported as Agent Skills (SKILL.md format) compatible with Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and Codex.

## Search

- **Full-text search**: Combines PostgreSQL full-text search (stemmed, ranked) with substring matching (ILIKE) in a single query. Matches against title, description, tags, URL (bookmarks), and content body. Items matching both methods rank highest. Supports operators: `"exact phrase"`, `-exclude`, and `OR`.
- **In-content search**: Search within a single item's content using literal string matching (case-insensitive by default, supports multiline queries). Returns matching lines with line numbers and surrounding context.
- **Filtering options**: Filter by content type (bookmark, note, prompt), tags (with AND/OR operator), view state (active, archived, or both), sort by created date, updated date, title, or last used date.
- **Unified search**: Search across all content types simultaneously via the `/content/` endpoint or the command palette. The `view` parameter accepts multiple values (e.g. `?view=active&view=archived`) to search across view states. When searching both active and archived with relevance sorting, archived items receive a relevance penalty so active content ranks higher.

## Content Versioning and History

Every content change is tracked:

- **Versioned actions**: Create, update, and restore operations are assigned sequential version numbers.
- **Audit actions**: Delete, undelete, archive, and unarchive are recorded without version numbers.
- **Version reconstruction**: Any previous version of content can be reconstructed and viewed.
- **Restore**: Content can be restored to any historical version, rebuilding the full state (content, title, description, tags, etc.).
- **Source tracking**: Each change records where it came from (web UI, MCP server, API) and the authentication method used.

## Content Lifecycle

Items have three states:

1. **Active**: Normal state, visible in default views.
2. **Archived**: Hidden from default views but preserved. Archived items can be included in searches by selecting the Archived view filter. They do not count toward tag counts. Can be unarchived at any time.
3. **Deleted (Trash)**: Soft-deleted, visible in trash. Can be restored. Items in trash will be automatically permanently deleted after 30 days (not yet deployed).

## AI Integration via MCP Servers

tiddly.me provides two MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that allow AI assistants (Claude, etc.) to read, search, create, and edit content.

### Content MCP Server

Provides access to bookmarks and notes.

**Tools available:**
- `search_items`: Search bookmarks and notes by query, tags, content type, with sorting and pagination.
- `get_item`: Retrieve full content of a bookmark or note. Supports partial reads (line ranges) for large items.
- `edit_content`: Edit content via exact string replacement (old_str/new_str). Preferred for surgical edits.
- `search_in_content`: Search within a specific item's content using regex. Returns matching lines with context.
- `update_item`: Update metadata (title, description, tags, URL, note).
- `create_bookmark`: Create a new bookmark with URL, title, description, note, tags, and content.
- `create_note`: Create a new note with title, content, description, and tags.
- `create_relationship`: Link two content items together.
- `get_context`: Get aggregated context including content counts, all tags, saved filters, and recent items.
- `list_tags`: List all tags with usage counts.
- `list_filters`: List saved content filters.

**Typical workflow**: Use `get_context` or `search_items` to find content, then `get_item` for full details. Use `edit_content` for precise edits or `update_item` for metadata changes.

### Prompt MCP Server

Provides access to prompts as both MCP tools and the MCP prompts capability.

**MCP Prompts (native MCP protocol):**
- `list_prompts`: List all prompts with their names, descriptions, and arguments.
- `get_prompt`: Render a prompt template with provided arguments and return the result.

**Tools available:**
- `search_prompts`: Search prompts by query and tags.
- `get_prompt_content`: Get raw (unrendered) template content. Supports partial reads.
- `get_prompt_metadata`: Get prompt metadata without content.
- `create_prompt`: Create a new prompt with name, title, content, description, tags, and arguments.
- `edit_prompt_content`: Edit part of a template via string replacement. Use when editing a specific section. Auto-syncs arguments when variables change.
- `update_prompt`: Rewrite, restructure, or fully replace template content, and/or update metadata (title, description, tags, name).
- `get_context`: Aggregated context for prompts.
- `list_tags`: Tags with counts.
- `list_filters`: Saved filters.

**Using prompts**: Agents consume prompts via the native MCP prompts capability — `list_prompts` to discover available prompts, `get_prompt` to render a template with arguments. This is the standard MCP protocol flow.

**Managing prompts**: The tools (`search_prompts`, `get_prompt_content`, `edit_prompt_content`, `create_prompt`, `update_prompt`) are for viewing raw templates, creating new prompts, and editing existing ones.

### MCP Endpoints

- Content MCP: `https://content-mcp.tiddly.me/mcp`
- Prompt MCP: `https://prompt-mcp.tiddly.me/mcp`

Test connectivity with curl:

```
# Content MCP
curl -X POST https://content-mcp.tiddly.me/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PAT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'

# Prompt MCP
curl -X POST https://prompt-mcp.tiddly.me/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PAT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

### Setting Up MCP Servers

All MCP setup requires a Personal Access Token (PAT). Generate one in Settings > Personal Access Tokens on tiddly.me. Replace `YOUR_PAT` below with your token. It is recommended to use separate PATs for each MCP server so access can be revoked independently. Treat PATs like passwords — never share them, commit them to version control, or expose them in client-side code. If compromised, revoke immediately in Settings and create a new one.

**Claude Desktop** — Add to config file (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bookmarks_notes": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://content-mcp.tiddly.me/mcp", "--header", "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PAT"]
    },
    "prompts": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://prompt-mcp.tiddly.me/mcp", "--header", "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PAT"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving. Uses `mcp-remote` as a bridge since Claude Desktop does not natively support streamable HTTP transport.

**Claude Code** — Run in your project directory:

```
claude mcp add --transport http bookmarks_notes https://content-mcp.tiddly.me/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PAT"

claude mcp add --transport http prompts https://prompt-mcp.tiddly.me/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PAT"
```

Note: Claude Code MCP servers are configured per project directory. Alternatively, if you've already configured Claude Desktop, run `claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop` to import those servers.

**Codex** — Add to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.bookmarks_notes]
url = "https://content-mcp.tiddly.me/mcp"
http_headers = { "Authorization" = "Bearer YOUR_PAT" }

[mcp_servers.prompts]
url = "https://prompt-mcp.tiddly.me/mcp"
http_headers = { "Authorization" = "Bearer YOUR_PAT" }
```

Note: Codex does not support MCP Prompts directly. To use saved prompts, ask Codex to fetch and apply them via tools (e.g., "Get my 'code-review' prompt and use it to review this file").

**ChatGPT** — Not yet supported. ChatGPT requires OAuth authentication, which is coming soon.

**Gemini CLI** — Not yet supported. Integration instructions coming soon.

### Programmatic API Access

The full REST API is available at `https://api.tiddly.me`. Authenticate with a PAT via `Authorization: Bearer bm_...` header. PATs support all read and write operations except sensitive endpoints (URL metadata scraping, token management, account settings).

## Platform

- **Status**: Currently in beta. Free to use during beta.
- **Open source**: The codebase is available at https://github.com/shane-kercheval/tiddly and can be self-hosted.
- **Infrastructure**: FastAPI backend, React frontend, PostgreSQL database (encryption at rest), Redis for caching and rate limiting. Hosted on Railway's Pro tier which includes SOC 2 compliance, DDoS protection, automatic daily database backups, and manual snapshots before major updates.
- **Authentication**: Auth0.
- **Multi-tenant**: All content is isolated by user ID. There is no sharing functionality.
- **Privacy**: No client-side/end-to-end encryption (would prevent full-text search). The database administrator could technically access user data. Self-hosting is available for complete privacy.
- **Data export**: Not yet available through the UI, but the full REST API can be used with a PAT to export content programmatically. A built-in export feature is planned.
- **Future plans**: Pricing tiers and limits have not been finalized. Any pricing changes will be announced well in advance, and existing users may be grandfathered. Optional AI-powered features (summarization, auto-suggestions, enhanced search) are planned but not yet implemented — these will be completely opt-in.

## Free Tier Limits

- **Items**: 100 bookmarks, 100 notes, 100 prompts.
- **Content length**: Up to 100,000 characters per item.
- **URL length**: Up to 2,048 characters.
- **Tags**: Tag names up to 50 characters.
- **Titles**: Up to 100 characters.
- **Descriptions**: Up to 1,000 characters.
- **Relationships**: Up to 50 per entity.
- **Version history**: 30-day retention, up to 100 versions per entity.
- **Personal Access Tokens**: Up to 10 active tokens.
- **Content filters**: Up to 10 filters, 10 sidebar collections.

## Use Cases and Examples

### Personal Knowledge Base
Save bookmarks to articles, write notes to summarize key learnings, tag everything by topic. Use content filters to create views like "All Python resources" or "Machine learning papers."

### AI Prompt Library
Build a library of reusable prompt templates. For example, a "Code Review" prompt with arguments for `language`, `code`, and `focus_area`. Render it via the MCP server from any AI assistant, or export as Agent Skills for Claude Code.

### Research and Reference
Bookmark research papers (page content is scraped and searchable), link related bookmarks and notes via relationships, and use version history to track how your notes evolve over time.

### AI-Assisted Content Management
Connect the MCP servers to Claude or another AI assistant. The AI can search your bookmarks and notes, create new content, edit existing items, and render prompt templates — all through natural conversation.

### Workflow Automation
Use PATs with the REST API to programmatically create bookmarks (e.g., from a browser extension or script), bulk-tag content, or integrate with other tools.
