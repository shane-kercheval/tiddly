Create a detailed implementation plan for an AI coding agent based on our discussion. Structure the plan as follows:

## Plan Requirements

- Break work into logical milestones, each covering a single component/module
- Each milestone should include: implementation, tests, and documentation updates
- Agent should complete one milestone fully before moving to the next
- Agent should stop after each milestone for human review
- Order milestones by logical dependencies
- DO NOT over-complicate or over-engineer the plan
  - e.g. DO account for things like error handling, edge cases, and testing
  - e.g. DON'T add advanced features that weren't discussed and may or may not be needed in the future
  - e.g. DO follow up with clarifying questions or suggestions if you recommend features or components that weren't discussed

## Implementation Guidelines

- Explain WHAT needs to change and WHY (focus on goals and rationale)
- Provide the agent with any documentation urls that we discussed or that you searched for and found relevant
- Make it clear that the agent should read the documentation before implementing
- Include code snippets for key patterns/interfaces, but avoid full implementations
- Highlight specific implementation details we've discussed, including testing strategies
- Agent should ask clarifying questions rather than make assumptions
- Prioritize meaningful, comprehensive tests over low-value tests
- Test edge cases and error conditions thoroughly

## Milestone Structure

For each milestone, specify:
1. **Goal**: What component/capability is being built/changed
2. **Success Criteria**: How to know the milestone is complete
3. **Key Changes**: Major modifications required
4. **Testing Strategy**: What needs testing and why
5. **Dependencies**: What must be done first
6. **Risk Factors**: Potential complications or unknowns

## Agent Behavior

- Complete each milestone fully (code + tests + docs) before proceeding
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Validate assumptions before implementing
- Focus on clean, maintainable solutions over quick fixes
- **No backwards compatibility required** - prioritize best practices and clean design patterns
- Breaking changes are acceptable and encouraged if they improve architecture
- Remove legacy code when it conflicts with better design
