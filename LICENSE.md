# License Information

Tiddly is licensed under the **Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2)**.

## What does this mean?

### ✅ You CAN:
- **Use** the software for personal or internal business purposes
- **Self-host** your own instance
- **View and modify** the source code
- **Fork** the project and make changes
- **Share** the code (with this license intact)

### ❌ You CANNOT:
- **Sell** the software itself
- **Offer it as a hosted service** to others commercially (e.g., run "Tiddly-as-a-Service" for customers)
- **Remove or alter** license/copyright notices

## Why this license?

The Elastic License 2.0 allows the project to remain open and accessible for self-hosting while preventing commercial competitors from simply taking the code and launching competing hosted services.

This approach:
- Keeps the code **transparent and auditable**
- Allows **full control** for self-hosters
- Prevents **unfair commercial exploitation**
- Encourages **community contributions**
