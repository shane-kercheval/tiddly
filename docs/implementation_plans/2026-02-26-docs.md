# Docs Site Implementation Plan

## Overview

Add public documentation pages to the existing React app at `/docs/*`, replacing the current Settings → AI Integration page with a Railway-style per-client setup flow. Also add changelog and roadmap pages at `/changelog` and `/roadmap`.

### Key Design Decisions

**In-app public routes, not a separate docs site:** The docs surface area (~15-20 pages) doesn't justify a separate framework like Docusaurus or Starlight. Public routes reuse the existing React/Tailwind design system, share a single deployment, and naturally funnel users to sign up. Railway's `/agents` pages follow this same pattern — they live on the main site, not a separate docs subdomain.

**Railway-style per-client pages instead of PyTorch selector matrix:** The current `SettingsMCP.tsx` (1,487 lines) handles a combinatorial matrix of integration type × server type × client type × auth type via selectors. The Railway approach collapses this to one dimension: pick your client, get a dedicated page with focused step-by-step instructions. This eliminates cognitive overhead and lets each page show BOTH server configs inline (no server selector needed). When a new client is added, you just add a new page.

**Skills live on per-client pages, not a standalone page:** Agent Skills are client-specific (sync command differs for Claude Code vs Codex vs Claude Desktop). A dedicated `/docs/ai/skills` page would recreate the selector problem — you'd land there and still have to pick a client. Instead, each client page has a complete reference: MCP Server setup first, then an Agent Skills section below for clients that support it. This keeps everything one-dimension: pick your client, get the full picture.

**Settings keeps account management, docs gets setup instructions:** PATs, tags, general preferences, and version history stay in Settings (they're transactional account actions). AI Integration setup and FAQ move to docs. Settings gets a bridge card linking to the docs.

**Changelog and roadmap at top-level paths:** `/changelog` and `/roadmap` are product communication, not reference docs. Excalidraw and Railway both place these at top-level rather than under `/docs`.

**FAQ moves to docs:** The current `SettingsFAQ.tsx` (483 lines) contains general product documentation (how search works, what filters do, archive vs delete, etc.) that belongs in public docs, not behind auth in Settings.

### URL Structure

/changelog                      → Changelog (top-level)
/roadmap                        → Roadmap (top-level)
```

### Existing Files to Reference

- Current AI Integration page: `frontend/src/pages/settings/SettingsMCP.tsx` (1,487 lines — source content to migrate)
- Current FAQ: `frontend/src/pages/settings/SettingsFAQ.tsx` (483 lines — moves to docs)
- Current tests: `frontend/src/pages/settings/SettingsMCP.test.tsx` (tests to migrate/replace)
- Routing: `frontend/src/App.tsx` (add new public routes)
- Landing page: `frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` (pattern for public page header/footer)
- Footer: `frontend/src/components/Footer.tsx` (reuse in docs layout)
- App layout: `frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx` (reference for sidebar pattern)
- Config: `frontend/src/config.ts` (MCP URLs for setup instructions)
- llms.txt: `frontend/public/llms.txt` (update with docs site links)
- Chrome extension README: `chrome-extension/README.md` (content source for extension docs)

### Visual Design Notes

- **Light code blocks:** Use a light theme (gray-100 background) for code snippets, not dark blocks. Consistent with the overall light aesthetic. The current SettingsMCP.tsx uses dark (`bg-gray-900`) code blocks for the main config examples — switch to light.
- **Copy buttons:** Keep the existing copy-to-clipboard pattern on all code blocks.
- **Orange accent:** Use the existing brand orange (`#f09040`, `bg-[#fff0e5]`, `text-[#d97b3d]`) sparingly for active states, links, and accents.
- **Generous whitespace:** Follow the landing page pattern — `max-w-4xl` (wider than settings `max-w-3xl`), generous padding, content that breathes.
- **Cards:** Use the existing card pattern (`rounded-lg border border-gray-200 bg-white`) for the hub page client cards.

## Milestone 1: DocsLayout + Routing Foundation

### Goal & Outcome

Create the docs layout shell, shared public layout components, and routing infrastructure. After this milestone:

- A shared `PublicHeader` component is extracted from `LandingPage.tsx` and reused across all public pages
- A `PublicPageLayout` component wraps standalone public pages (changelog, roadmap) with header + content + footer
- `/docs` renders a public page with a sidebar nav and main content area
- `/docs/*` routes exist and render placeholder content
- `/changelog` and `/roadmap` routes exist with placeholder content inside `PublicPageLayout`
- The sidebar nav shows the full docs structure with active state highlighting
- The layout is responsive (sidebar collapses on mobile)
- Landing page header links to docs
- The docs layout matches the site's visual style (light, clean, same header/footer as landing page)

### Implementation Outline

**1. Extract `PublicHeader` component (`frontend/src/components/PublicHeader.tsx`)**

Extract the header from `LandingPage.tsx` (lines 23-38) into a reusable component. The header shows: logo on left, login/signup buttons on right (or "Open App" if authenticated). Add a "Docs" link in the header between the logo and auth buttons. Refactor `LandingPage.tsx` to use `PublicHeader` instead of its inline header.

**2. Create `PublicPageLayout` component (`frontend/src/components/PublicPageLayout.tsx`)**

A simple layout wrapper for standalone public pages (changelog, roadmap, and any future top-level public pages): `PublicHeader` + content area (`<Outlet />`) + `Footer`. No sidebar. This prevents each standalone page from independently rendering header/footer.

**3. Create `DocsLayout` component (`frontend/src/components/DocsLayout.tsx`)**

A public layout (no auth required) with:
- `PublicHeader` at the top (shared with landing page, changelog, roadmap)
- Left sidebar with nested navigation matching the URL structure above
- Main content area: `max-w-4xl` with generous padding
- Footer: reuse the existing `Footer` component
- Sidebar collapses to a hamburger menu on mobile (below `md` breakpoint). The docs sidebar should be visually consistent with the app sidebar (same widths, colors, transitions) but architecturally independent — a simple static nav tree with a hamburger toggle, not a reuse of the app's `Sidebar.tsx` component which has DnD, stores, collections, and other app-specific concerns.

The sidebar nav should be a data-driven component. Define the nav tree as a constant array:

```tsx
interface DocNavItem {
  label: string
  path: string
  children?: DocNavItem[]
}

const docsNav: DocNavItem[] = [
  { label: 'Overview', path: '/docs' },
  { label: 'Getting Started', path: '/docs/getting-started' },
  {
    label: 'AI Integration',
    path: '/docs/ai',
    children: [
      { label: 'Claude Desktop', path: '/docs/ai/claude-desktop' },
      { label: 'Claude Code', path: '/docs/ai/claude-code' },
      { label: 'Codex', path: '/docs/ai/codex' },
      { label: 'ChatGPT', path: '/docs/ai/chatgpt' },
      { label: 'Gemini CLI', path: '/docs/ai/gemini-cli' },
      { label: 'MCP Tools', path: '/docs/ai/mcp-tools' },
    ],
  },
  // ... etc
]
```

Use `useLocation()` to highlight the active nav item. Parent items auto-expand when a child is active.

**4. Add routes to `App.tsx`**

Add public routes under the `RootLayout` alongside the existing public routes (`/`, `/privacy`, `/terms`). The docs routes use `DocsLayout` as their layout wrapper. Changelog and roadmap nest under `PublicPageLayout`:

```tsx
// Public docs routes
{
  element: <DocsLayout />,
  children: [
    { path: '/docs', element: <DocsOverview /> },
    { path: '/docs/getting-started', element: <DocsGettingStarted /> },
    { path: '/docs/ai', element: <DocsAIHub /> },
    { path: '/docs/ai/claude-desktop', element: <DocsClaudeDesktop /> },
    // ... all docs routes
    { path: '/docs/faq', element: <DocsFAQ /> },
  ],
},
// Top-level public routes with shared header/footer
{
  element: <PublicPageLayout />,
  children: [
    { path: '/changelog', element: <Changelog /> },
    { path: '/roadmap', element: <Roadmap /> },
  ],
},
```

**5. Create placeholder pages**

Create `frontend/src/pages/docs/` directory. Each page is a simple component with a title and "Coming soon" placeholder, just enough to verify routing and layout work. The changelog and roadmap pages go in `frontend/src/pages/` (not under docs).

**6. Update landing page and footer**

Refactor `LandingPage.tsx` to use the new `PublicHeader` component. Add "Docs" link to the footer.

**7. Create a `usePageTitle` equivalent for docs**

Use the existing `usePageTitle` hook from docs pages. Example: `usePageTitle('Docs - AI Integration')`.

### Testing Strategy

Tests for shared components, DocsLayout, and routing:

- **PublicHeader renders logo and auth buttons**: Render PublicHeader without auth, verify logo and login/signup buttons are present
- **PublicHeader shows "Open App" when authenticated**: Render PublicHeader with auth context, verify "Open App" link replaces login/signup
- **PublicHeader renders "Docs" link**: Verify "Docs" link is present in the header
- **LandingPage still renders correctly after refactor**: Render landing page, verify header renders via PublicHeader (logo, auth buttons, Docs link)
- **DocsLayout renders header, sidebar, and footer**: Render DocsLayout at `/docs`, verify PublicHeader, nav links, and footer are present
- **Sidebar nav renders all sections**: Verify all top-level nav items and their children render
- **Active nav item highlighting**: Render at `/docs/ai/claude-code`, verify that "Claude Code" and its parent "AI Integration" have active styling
- **Mobile sidebar toggle**: Verify the sidebar is hidden on small screens and a menu button is present
- **Public routes don't require auth**: Render `/docs` without auth context, verify it renders (no redirect to login)
- **Docs routes render within DocsLayout**: Navigate to `/docs/ai`, verify it renders inside the docs layout (sidebar visible)
- **Changelog/roadmap render within PublicPageLayout**: Navigate to `/changelog`, verify it renders with PublicHeader and Footer but no docs sidebar
- **Landing page links to docs**: Render landing page, verify "Docs" link exists in header

## Milestone 2: AI Integration Hub + Per-Client Pages

### Goal & Outcome

Migrate the AI Integration content from `SettingsMCP.tsx` into dedicated docs pages. After this milestone:

- `/docs/ai` shows a card grid with all supported AI clients (Railway-style)
- Each client card links to its dedicated setup page
- `/docs/ai/claude-desktop`, `/docs/ai/claude-code`, `/docs/ai/codex` have full setup instructions including both MCP Server setup and Agent Skills export
- `/docs/ai/chatgpt` and `/docs/ai/gemini-cli` show "coming soon" pages
- Each client page shows BOTH Content and Prompt server configs (no server selector)
- Each client page that supports Skills (Claude Code, Codex, Claude Desktop) has a Skills section below the MCP setup with tag filtering and sync commands
- Code blocks have copy-to-clipboard buttons
- Example prompts section on each client page
- "Coming soon" cards have a distinct visual treatment (grayed out, no link)

### Implementation Outline

**1. AI Hub page (`frontend/src/pages/docs/DocsAIHub.tsx`)**

Railway-style layout:
- Brief intro paragraph explaining what MCP is, what the two servers do, and mentioning that you can also export prompts as Agent Skills
- Card grid (2 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile) with one card per client
- Each card shows: client name, brief description (e.g. "CLI command" or "JSON config"), status badge if coming soon
- Supported clients link to their setup page; coming-soon clients are non-clickable with a "Coming soon" badge
- At the bottom: "Example prompts" section with 5-6 example prompts in pill/chip format:
  - "Search my bookmarks about React hooks"
  - "Create a note summarizing what I read today"
  - "Find my code-review prompt and use it on this file"
  - "List all my prompts tagged 'writing'"
  - "Edit my 'daily-standup' prompt to add a new section"

**2. Shared components (`frontend/src/pages/docs/components/`)**

Extract reusable components used across multiple client pages:

- **`CopyableCodeBlock`**: Pre-formatted code block with copy button. Takes `code: string`, `language?: string` props. Uses light theme (`bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200`) with a Copy button that shows "Copied!" for 2 seconds. This replaces the many individual copy-state handlers scattered across the current SettingsMCP.tsx.
- **`StepSection`**: Numbered step with heading and content. Takes `step: number`, `title: string`, `children: ReactNode`. Provides consistent heading styling.
- **`InfoCallout`**: Styled callout box for tips/notes. Takes `variant: 'info' | 'warning' | 'tip'`, `title?: string`, `children: ReactNode`.
- **`CreateTokenStep`**: Shared "Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token" component used by all client pages. Contains the description + link to `/app/settings/tokens`. (Note: the link goes to the authenticated app — users must be logged in to create tokens.)
- **`SkillsTagSelector`**: Migrated from SettingsMCP.tsx (lines 793-929). Multi-select tag dropdown for filtering which prompts to export as Skills. Fetches tags from `GET /tags/?content_types=prompt`. **Important: must check `isAuthenticated` from `useAuthStatus()` before making any API calls.** On public pages, unauthenticated API calls will trigger the auth interceptor's 401 retry logic, which calls `logout()` and redirects to Auth0 — this is wrong for public docs pages. When not authenticated, skip the tags fetch entirely.
- **`SkillsSection`**: Wrapper component used by client pages that support Skills. Takes `client: 'claude-code' | 'codex' | 'claude-desktop'` and renders: Skills explanation, tag selector (if authenticated), and client-specific sync/download commands. Handles the unauthenticated case by showing "log in to filter" and defaulting to all prompts (no API calls made). Includes `buildSkillsExportUrl` and `getDefaultSkillTags` helpers.

**3. Per-client pages**

Each page follows the same template. Example for Claude Code (`frontend/src/pages/docs/DocsClaudeCode.tsx`):

**MCP Server Setup** (primary section):
1. **Title + description**: "Tiddly + Claude Code" — brief description of Claude Code
2. **Prerequisites**: "You'll need a Personal Access Token" with link to create one
3. **Content Server setup**: Numbered steps with the `claude mcp add` command for the content server
4. **Prompt Server setup**: Same steps for the prompt server
5. **Verify**: "Try asking Claude Code to search my bookmarks"
6. **Tips**: Per-project config note, import-from-Claude-Desktop alternative

**Agent Skills** (optional section, below a divider — only for clients that support Skills: Claude Code, Codex, Claude Desktop):
1. Brief explanation: what Skills are (2 sentences), why you'd use them alongside or instead of MCP
2. **Filter by tags**: Tag selector to choose which prompts to export (requires auth — show "log in to filter" if not authenticated, or export all prompts by default)
3. **Sync command**: Client-specific command (e.g. `curl ... | tar -xzf -` for Claude Code)
4. **Usage**: How to invoke skills once synced (e.g. `/skill-name` for Claude Code)

The `SkillsTagSelector` component (currently in SettingsMCP.tsx lines 793-929) and helper functions (`buildSkillsExportUrl`, `getDefaultSkillTags`) become shared components in `frontend/src/pages/docs/components/` since they're used across multiple client pages.

**Example prompts**: Same pill/chip section as the hub page (keep it on individual pages too — users may land directly here)

Key changes from current SettingsMCP.tsx:
- **Both servers shown inline** — no server selector. Show Content server first, then Prompt server, with a small heading for each. The configs are short enough that showing both is cleaner than a selector.
- **Light code blocks** — switch from `bg-gray-900 text-gray-100` to `bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 text-gray-800`
- **Copy button reused** via `CopyableCodeBlock` component — eliminates the 6+ individual copy state handlers in the current code

Content for each client comes directly from the current SettingsMCP.tsx components:
- Claude Desktop: `ClaudeDesktopInstructions` (lines 155-336) → show combined config with both servers in one JSON block
- Claude Code: `ClaudeCodeInstructions` (lines 338-483) → show both `claude mcp add` commands
- Codex: `CodexInstructions` (lines 504-636) → show combined TOML config

**4. Coming soon pages (`DocsAIChatGPT.tsx`, `DocsAIGeminiCLI.tsx`)**

Simple page with the `ComingSoon` pattern (clock icon, title, description) explaining why it's not available yet and what's needed (OAuth for ChatGPT, etc.).

### Testing Strategy

**CopyableCodeBlock component:**
- Renders code content
- Copy button copies text to clipboard
- Shows "Copied!" feedback for 2 seconds, then reverts
- Handles clipboard API failure gracefully (no crash)

**AI Hub page:**
- Renders all client cards (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Codex, ChatGPT, Gemini CLI)
- Supported client cards are links to their setup pages
- Coming soon cards are not links (verify no `<a>` tag)
- Example prompts section renders
- Intro text mentions both MCP and Skills

**Per-client pages (test one thoroughly, smoke test others):**

Claude Code page (thorough):
- Renders page title "Tiddly + Claude Code" (or similar)
- Shows "Create a Personal Access Token" step with link to `/app/settings/tokens`
- Shows Content server setup with correct `claude mcp add` command containing the content MCP URL
- Shows Prompt server setup with correct `claude mcp add` command containing the prompt MCP URL
- Copy buttons work (mock clipboard, verify `writeText` called with correct command)
- Shows the "Import from Claude Desktop" alternative tip
- Shows Agent Skills section with explanation, tag selector (when authenticated), and sync command
- When not authenticated: Skills section shows "log in to filter" message, tag selector is hidden, sync command still shown (with default "all prompts" URL), and no API calls are made (verify no fetch to `/tags/`)
- Shows example prompts section

Claude Desktop page (smoke):
- Renders title
- Shows both server configs in a combined JSON block (the `mcpServers` object contains both `bookmarks_notes` and `prompts`)
- Shows macOS and Windows config file paths with copy buttons
- Shows "Restart Claude Desktop" step

Codex page (smoke):
- Renders title
- Shows combined TOML config with both servers
- Shows "Using Prompts" note about Codex not supporting MCP Prompts directly

Coming soon pages:
- ChatGPT page shows "Coming Soon" message mentioning OAuth
- Gemini CLI page shows "Coming Soon" message

---

## Milestone 3: MCP Tools Reference

### Goal & Outcome

Migrate the MCP tools reference from SettingsMCP.tsx. After this milestone:

- `/docs/ai/mcp-tools` shows the available tools for both Content and Prompt MCP servers
- The page serves as a reference that client pages can link to (e.g. "See all available tools →")

Note: Skills export was integrated into per-client pages in Milestone 2, so there is no standalone Skills page.

### Implementation Outline

**1. MCP Tools reference page (`frontend/src/pages/docs/DocsAIMCPTools.tsx`)**

Migrate the `AvailableTools` component (lines 664-781 of SettingsMCP.tsx):
- Show both Content server and Prompt server tools (no selector — show both sections)
- Use the existing table format (mobile: section/bullet format; desktop: table with category grouping)
- Add brief explanations of common workflows:
  - Content: "Use `get_context` → `search_items` → `get_item` for reading; `edit_content` for surgical edits"
  - Prompts: "Use `get_context` → `search_prompts` → `get_prompt_content` for viewing; `edit_prompt_content` for edits"
- Link back to client setup pages for context

### Testing Strategy

**MCP Tools page:**
- Renders Content server tools section with all tools (get_context, search_items, etc.)
- Renders Prompt server tools section with all tools
- Desktop table format renders with category grouping (rowSpan)
- Mobile format renders as section/bullet layout

---

## Milestone 4: FAQ Migration + Settings Bridge

### Goal & Outcome

Migrate FAQ from Settings to docs, update Settings to link to docs, and remove the old SettingsMCP page. After this milestone:

- `/docs/faq` contains all FAQ content (migrated from `SettingsFAQ.tsx`)
- Settings no longer has the MCP/AI Integration page
- Settings no longer has the FAQ page
- Settings has a bridge card/link pointing to docs for AI Integration setup
- Sidebar navigation in the app's Settings section updated (removes MCP and FAQ items, adds docs link)
- Old `SettingsMCP.tsx` and `SettingsFAQ.tsx` files are deleted
- Old test file `SettingsMCP.test.tsx` is deleted (replaced by new per-page tests)
- `llms.txt` updated to reference docs pages

### Implementation Outline

**1. FAQ docs page (`frontend/src/pages/docs/DocsFAQ.tsx`)**

Migrate the FAQ content from `SettingsFAQ.tsx` (lines 1-483). Keep the same `FAQSection` and `FAQItem` component pattern (or simplify — they're straightforward). The content is the same; the wrapper changes from a Settings page to a docs page.

Reorganize FAQ sections if needed, but do NOT add or remove questions — keep the content identical to avoid scope creep.

**2. Update Settings sidebar**

In `frontend/src/components/sidebar/Sidebar.tsx`, the Settings group currently contains links to: General, Tokens, AI Integration, Tags, History, FAQ.

Remove "AI Integration" and "FAQ" from the sidebar. Add a "Docs" link that opens `/docs` (navigating out of the app layout to the public docs site). Since this navigates from an authenticated page to a public page, use a regular `<a>` tag (not React Router `<Link>`) or handle the layout transition appropriately.

**3. Add bridge card in Settings**

In `SettingsGeneral.tsx` (or a dedicated spot), add a small card/banner:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  AI Integration                               │
│  Connect AI assistants to your content        │
│  [View Setup Guide →]                         │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This replaces the full MCP settings page with a lightweight pointer to docs.

**4. Delete old files**

- Delete `frontend/src/pages/settings/SettingsMCP.tsx`
- Delete `frontend/src/pages/settings/SettingsMCP.test.tsx`
- Delete `frontend/src/pages/settings/SettingsFAQ.tsx`
- Remove corresponding route entries from `App.tsx`
- Remove imports from `App.tsx`

**5. Update `llms.txt`**

Update the "Setting Up MCP Servers" section to reference docs pages:
- "For setup instructions, visit https://tiddly.me/docs/ai"
- Keep the quick-reference config snippets for each client (these are consumed by LLMs and need to be self-contained)
- Add a link to the docs site in the "Platform" section

### Testing Strategy

**FAQ page:**
- Renders all FAQ sections from the migrated content
- Each section has its heading
- FAQ items render question and answer
- Links within answers work (e.g. link to settings/tokens)

**Settings sidebar:**
- Settings group no longer shows "AI Integration" item
- Settings group no longer shows "FAQ" item
- Settings group shows a "Docs" link
- Docs link navigates to `/docs`

**Settings bridge card:**
- Bridge card renders in settings
- "View Setup Guide" links to `/docs/ai`

**Route removal:**
- `/app/settings/mcp` no longer routes to SettingsMCP (returns 404 or redirects)
- `/app/settings/faq` no longer routes to SettingsFAQ (returns 404 or redirects)

**App.tsx imports:**
- No import of `SettingsMCP` or `SettingsFAQ` remains in App.tsx

---

## Milestone 5: Extensions Docs + API Overview

### Goal & Outcome

Add extension documentation and API overview pages. After this milestone:

- `/docs/extensions` shows an extensions hub with cards for Chrome and Safari
- `/docs/extensions/chrome` has Chrome extension setup instructions (migrated from `chrome-extension/README.md`)
- `/docs/extensions/safari` shows "coming soon"
- `/docs/api` has API overview with authentication docs (PATs, rate limits)
- The API overview links to individual endpoint pages (which will be placeholder stubs for now)

### Implementation Outline

**1. Extensions hub (`frontend/src/pages/docs/DocsExtensionsHub.tsx`)**

Card grid similar to the AI hub, but simpler (just 2 cards):
- Chrome extension card: "Save bookmarks from any page with one click" + link to `/docs/extensions/chrome`
- Safari extension card: "Coming soon" badge, grayed out

**2. Chrome extension page (`frontend/src/pages/docs/DocsExtensionsChrome.tsx`)**

Migrate content from `chrome-extension/README.md`:
- Features: one-click save, tag selection, page content capture, search on new tab
- Installation: Chrome Web Store link (or "Load unpacked" for development)
- Setup: Create PAT, open extension options, enter token, test connection
- Usage: how the save flow works, how search works on restricted pages
- Default tags configuration

**3. Safari extension page (`frontend/src/pages/docs/DocsExtensionsSafari.tsx`)**

Simple "coming soon" placeholder.

**4. API overview page (`frontend/src/pages/docs/DocsAPI.tsx`)**

- Authentication section: how PATs work, where to create them, `Authorization: Bearer bm_...` header
- Base URL: `https://api.tiddly.me`
- Rate limits: table of rate limits by auth type and operation (from CLAUDE.md)
- Self-hosting note: link to `README_DEPLOY.md` on GitHub
- Quick links to individual endpoint docs (placeholder pages)
- Example curl request showing a simple API call

**5. Parameterized route for API endpoint stubs**

Instead of creating 6 nearly-identical stub files, use a single parameterized route:

```tsx
{ path: '/docs/api/:endpoint', element: <DocsAPIEndpoint /> }
```

The `DocsAPIEndpoint` component reads the `:endpoint` param, maps it to a title (e.g. `bookmarks` → "Bookmark Endpoints"), and renders "Endpoint documentation coming soon" with a link to the FastAPI auto-generated docs. Unknown endpoint params should redirect to `/docs/api`. This covers: bookmarks, notes, prompts, content, tags, history.

### Testing Strategy

**Extensions hub:**
- Renders Chrome and Safari cards
- Chrome card links to `/docs/extensions/chrome`
- Safari card shows "Coming soon" and is not a link

**Chrome extension page:**
- Renders setup instructions
- Shows PAT creation step
- Shows installation instructions

**API overview:**
- Renders authentication section
- Renders rate limits table
- Renders base URL
- Links to individual endpoint stub pages

**API endpoint stubs (parameterized):**
- Renders correct title for known endpoints (e.g. `/docs/api/bookmarks` → "Bookmark Endpoints")
- Shows "coming soon" message with link to FastAPI docs
- Unknown endpoint params redirect to `/docs/api`

---

## Milestone 6: Docs Overview, Getting Started, Changelog, Roadmap

### Goal & Outcome

Fill in the remaining docs pages and the top-level changelog/roadmap pages. After this milestone:

- `/docs` shows a polished overview of what tiddly.me is and links to all doc sections
- `/docs/getting-started` has a quick start guide (sign up → first bookmark → first note → first prompt)
- `/changelog` shows a reverse-chronological changelog with monthly groupings
- `/roadmap` shows a three-tier roadmap (Shipped, In Progress, Planned)
- All placeholder pages from Milestone 1 are replaced with real content

### Implementation Outline

**1. Docs overview page (`frontend/src/pages/docs/DocsOverview.tsx`)**

- Brief intro: what tiddly.me is (a content management platform for bookmarks, notes, and prompts with AI integration)
- Section cards linking to major doc areas: Getting Started, AI Integration, Extensions, API, FAQ
- Each card has a heading, brief description, and arrow link
- This is the landing page for `/docs` — keep it scannable

**2. Getting Started page (`frontend/src/pages/docs/DocsGettingStarted.tsx`)**

Quick start guide for new users:
1. Sign up at tiddly.me
2. Save your first bookmark (paste a URL)
3. Create your first note (markdown editor)
4. Create your first prompt (Jinja2 template with arguments)
5. Connect an AI assistant (link to `/docs/ai`)
6. Install the Chrome extension (link to `/docs/extensions/chrome`)

Keep it brief — link to other docs pages for details rather than duplicating content.

**3. Changelog page (`frontend/src/pages/changelog/Changelog.tsx`)**

Excalidraw-style, rendered from a typed data structure rather than hardcoded JSX. This makes future changelog updates trivial (edit a data array, not JSX) and enables future features (RSS, API access) if needed.

Define a typed data structure (in the same file or a co-located `changelogData.ts`):

```tsx
interface ChangelogEntry { title: string; description?: string }
interface ChangelogMonth {
  month: string  // e.g. "February"
  year: number
  categories: {
    features?: ChangelogEntry[]
    improvements?: ChangelogEntry[]
    fixes?: ChangelogEntry[]
  }
}
const changelog: ChangelogMonth[] = [...]
```

The component maps over this data to render:
- Reverse chronological, grouped by month
- Each month has a heading (e.g. "February 2026")
- Categories within each month rendered only if non-empty: New Features, Improvements, Bug Fixes
- Each item is a bullet point with title and optional description
- Start with the last 2-3 months of changes (retroactively from git history and the implementation plans). Don't exhaustively cover every commit — focus on user-facing changes.

Layout: simple single-column, no sidebar. Rendered within `PublicPageLayout` (shared header/footer, no docs sidebar) since this is a top-level page.

**4. Roadmap page (`frontend/src/pages/roadmap/Roadmap.tsx`)**

Same data-driven approach as changelog. Define a typed data structure:

```tsx
interface RoadmapItem { title: string; description: string }
interface RoadmapData {
  shipped: RoadmapItem[]
  inProgress: RoadmapItem[]
  planned: RoadmapItem[]
}
const roadmap: RoadmapData = { ... }
```

Excalidraw-style three-tier layout:
- **Shipped** — recently completed features (last 1-2 months)
- **In Progress** — what's actively being worked on
- **Planned** — what's coming (no dates)

Each item is a card with: feature name + 1-2 sentence description. Vertically stacked sections (not columns — better for mobile). Rendered within `PublicPageLayout`.

Populate with real content based on recent work and known plans. Examples:
- Shipped: Chrome extension, content versioning, MCP servers, search improvements
- In Progress: Docs site, Safari extension
- Planned: Pro tier, data export, AI-powered features (summarization, auto-suggestions)

### Testing Strategy

**Docs overview:**
- Renders intro text
- Renders section cards with links to AI Integration, Extensions, API, FAQ, Getting Started
- Section card links navigate correctly

**Getting Started:**
- Renders numbered steps
- Contains links to `/docs/ai`, `/docs/extensions/chrome`

**Changelog:**
- Renders monthly groupings in reverse chronological order
- Each month has category headings (New Features, etc.)
- Items render as bullet points with descriptions

**Roadmap:**
- Renders three sections: Shipped, In Progress, Planned
- Each section has feature cards with names and descriptions
- Sections are visually distinct

## Summary

| Milestone | Component | Scope |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | DocsLayout + routing | PublicHeader extraction, PublicPageLayout, DocsLayout with sidebar nav, routing, placeholder pages |
| 2 | AI Integration hub + client pages | Hub card grid, Claude Desktop/Code/Codex setup pages (MCP + Skills), shared components |
| 3 | MCP Tools reference | MCP tools reference tables for both servers |
| 4 | FAQ migration + Settings cleanup | Move FAQ to docs, remove old MCP/FAQ from Settings, add bridge card, update llms.txt |
| 5 | Extensions + API overview | Chrome extension docs, API overview with auth/rate limits, endpoint stubs |
| 6 | Overview, Getting Started, Changelog, Roadmap | Docs landing page, quick start guide, changelog, roadmap |

### Not In Scope (future work)

- Individual API endpoint documentation (beyond overview + stubs)
- In-docs search (15-20 pages doesn't need it yet)
- Prev/next navigation between docs pages
- Table of contents sidebar within individual docs pages
- Dark mode for docs
- Safari extension implementation (only the "coming soon" placeholder)
- SEO optimization (meta tags, OpenGraph, etc.)
- Custom domain (`docs.tiddly.me` — using `/docs` path instead)
