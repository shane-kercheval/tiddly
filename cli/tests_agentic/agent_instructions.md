# CLI Agent Testing Procedure

End-to-end verification of the `tiddly` CLI. Structured for an AI agent to execute against a **local** dev environment.

Each test describes a **behavioral claim**. You decide how to verify it — write whatever shell / `jq` / `uv run python3` / filesystem checks fit your environment.

**Every bash snippet in this document is a suggestion, not a mandate.** Phase 0's setup block, Phase 9's teardown block, the `tokens create` fixture in T5.8c, the `jq`-filter-and-sort compare in T6.6/T6.7 — these are illustrative of HOW to accomplish the goal described in prose. They are **not** the test. The test is the behavioral claim. The shell is a means to verify it.

If a suggested command fails in your environment (wrong shell idiom, missing tool, output format that differs from what the doc assumed, regex that doesn't match, etc.), your job is to **adapt your approach and carry on** — not to halt because the example didn't run. See [§ When something goes wrong](#when-something-goes-wrong) for how to distinguish that case from a genuine product-behavior mismatch.

## Runs against LOCAL test services ONLY

```
TIDDLY_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
TIDDLY_CONTENT_MCP_URL=http://localhost:8001/mcp
TIDDLY_PROMPT_MCP_URL=http://localhost:8002/mcp
```

Phase 0 aborts if these aren't set. The tokens this procedure mints live only on the local dev server. The user's **real config files** on disk (`~/.claude.json`, Claude Desktop config, `~/.codex/config.toml`) are reused — Phase 0 backs them up, sanitizes them, and Phase 9 restores the originals. Everything between Phase 0 and Phase 9 is a reversible mutation of real files. Treat the backup directory accordingly.

---

## When something goes wrong

There are two very different "something went wrong" cases. Treat them differently.

### Case A: a suggested command didn't work — adapt and continue

If a snippet in this document doesn't produce what the prose says it should — but the issue is with the **snippet**, not the product — adapt your approach and keep going. This is the expected path, not an error condition. The most common reasons:

- Your shell (zsh vs bash) parses an idiom differently.
- A tool the example assumed (`jq`, `awk`, `uv run python3`) is on a different version or absent.
- The CLI's output format shifted slightly in a way that doesn't contradict the claim (e.g. extra whitespace, a new line that doesn't affect meaning).
- The example has a regex typo or shell-quirk bug (zsh `$var[...]` subscript, `grep -q` under `pipefail`, a missing `--` option terminator).
- The suggested setup step doesn't compose cleanly with the state left by a previous test.

In any of these, adapt: verify the claim a different way. Dump the raw observation, understand what the actual behavior is, write a different check. Your strength is exactly this kind of local reasoning.

**Concrete example.** Say T2.7 suggests asserting `jq -e '.mcpServers.tiddly_notes_bookmarks.args | index("mcp-remote")' $CLAUDE_DESKTOP_CONFIG`, and `index` returns `null` on your config because `args` is shaped differently than the doc assumed. You check with `jq '.mcpServers.tiddly_notes_bookmarks.args' $CLAUDE_DESKTOP_CONFIG` and see `args` does contain `"mcp-remote"` — just not as a top-level string. Switch to `jq -e '.mcpServers.tiddly_notes_bookmarks.args | any(.[]?; . == "mcp-remote")' ...` and continue. Log:

```
- T2.7 PASS (adapted: jq index → any(.[]?;) for nested-array shape)
```

This is a signal, not a failure. It tells the engineer where the procedure's suggested shell is unreliable or outdated so they can tighten it.

**SKIP variant — inconclusive after fair adaptation.** When a test genuinely can't be verified — not because the product misbehaves, but because the local environment or dev DB doesn't have the preconditions (e.g. T6.6 where no prompts in this dev DB match the required tags) — log `- T<id> SKIP (adapted <n> ways, inconclusive — <one-line reason>)`. **SKIP is never an alternative to Case B.** If you have any evidence the product behavior contradicts the claim, report Case B regardless of how many adaptations you've tried. SKIP is narrowly for "the test can't meaningfully fire in this environment."

If your adaptation reveals that the product actually **does** misbehave (the different approach also fails, for the same observable reason), that's Case B below.

### Case B: the product's behavior contradicts the claim — stop and report

When, after fair effort to verify it, the CLI's observable behavior contradicts the test's **behavioral claim** — that is the signal this procedure is designed to surface. Do the following:

1. **Stop.** Do not run any cleanup, restore, or token-revocation step. Do not move to the next test. Do not adapt the **claim** itself — the claim is the test; rewriting it to match the product defeats the purpose.
2. **Report.** Append a structured block to `$REPORT`:
   - Test ID.
   - The claim in your own words.
   - What you actually observed — command you ran, exit code, relevant output (paraphrased, never a raw Bearer value).
   - Category: **product-bug** (CLI's behavior is wrong), **plan-bug** (the claim is outdated or the test is mis-specified), **environment** (API down, auth died, permission issue), **ambiguous** (not enough evidence to classify).
   - A one-sentence hypothesis if you have one.
3. **Wait** for the engineer. They'll decide whether this is a real bug, a plan update, or something you should retry.

### Before you report under Case B, sanity-check

- **Did you understand the claim correctly?** Re-read the test prose.
- **Did you rule out a snippet issue?** Under Case A, you should have already tried a second approach. If multiple reasonable ways to verify the claim all independently show the product doing something different from what the claim says, that's a real product-vs-claim mismatch.
- **Is it environmental?** `bin/tiddly auth status` and `bin/tiddly status` — if auth died or the API is down mid-run, that's environment, not a product bug.

If you still can't tell between product-bug and plan-bug on the evidence you have, mark **ambiguous** and report. Don't guess.

### There is intentionally no automatic destructive recovery

A mismatch is almost always (1) a product bug to investigate with the state preserved, (2) a plan bug to adjust, or (3) a snippet-authoring issue you've already worked around under Case A. None of those want a full session wipe. Preserve state; wait for the engineer.

---

## Never echo plaintext Bearer values

The only place plaintext PAT values should ever surface is from the explicit `tiddly tokens create` path, and those must be consumed immediately (piped into a config mutation, assigned to a shell variable that is `unset` right after use). Specifically:

- **Never** `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`, or `grep -o 'Bearer .*'` on a config file. Use `jq -e` / `tomllib` with exit-code assertions that don't print values.
- **Never** include raw config contents or Bearer values in your report. If what you want to report is token-bearing, hash it, name it (the `cli-mcp-*` name), or cite the first 12 characters of the PAT prefix (safe — that's what `tokens list` shows) instead of the full value.
- **Never** `set -x` around a block that has a captured PAT — it echoes every assignment including the token.
- On any `configure` / `remove` / `dry-run` output you're about to echo, call `assert_no_plaintext_bearers "$out" "T<id>"` from `lib.sh` first. It FATALs if a raw Bearer slipped through the CLI's redactor. If it fires, that **is** the finding — report it and stop.

---

## Prerequisites

- CLI binary built: `make cli-build` produces `bin/tiddly` at the repo root.
- Local API + MCP servers running on their default ports (8000 / 8001 / 8002).
- **Python invocations go through `uv run`**: the project manages its Python environment with `uv`, not system `python3`. When a test needs Python (most often for TOML parsing via stdlib `tomllib`), prefer `uv run python3 -c '...'`. Bare `python3` will sometimes work (stdlib-only) but is stylistically inconsistent with the rest of the repo and can hit version drift on machines where system python lags the uv-managed one.
- Backend `VITE_DEV_MODE=false`. Dev mode short-circuits PAT validation and silently breaks tests that depend on server-side token checks (T2.12 canonical reuse, T5.8 canonical revoke, T5.8d orphan filter). Phase 0 has an explicit probe; failing that probe means fix dev mode and re-run Phase 0.
- OAuth session alive via `bin/tiddly login` — see [§ Auth](#auth-engineer-must-do-this-manually).

---

## Auth (engineer must do this manually)

The agent cannot complete the OAuth device flow (requires a browser). This must be set up **before** the agent is launched.

### Critical — `.env` is NOT read by the CLI

The Go CLI reads **shell environment variables**, not `backend/.env`. Variables like `VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN` are backend/frontend-only; the CLI can't see them. If you skip the exports below and run `bin/tiddly login` bare, the CLI falls back to hardcoded **production** defaults and your token ends up being a production token that the local backend will 401 on.

If you already ran `bin/tiddly login` bare and ended up logged into production, run `bin/tiddly logout` first, then start over from step 2.

### Auth0 values — these are not secrets

Auth0 domain, client ID, and audience are public identifiers. They ship in frontend bundles and OAuth URLs. The values below are for this repo's dev Auth0 tenant. If you forked with a different tenant, replace them.

### Paste this block in a fresh terminal

```bash
make cli-build

export TIDDLY_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
export TIDDLY_CONTENT_MCP_URL=http://localhost:8001/mcp
export TIDDLY_PROMPT_MCP_URL=http://localhost:8002/mcp

# Dev Auth0 tenant. The CLIENT_ID below is the dedicated Native Auth0
# application (has Device Code grant enabled) — NOT the frontend SPA
# client from backend/.env, which doesn't have device flow enabled.
export TIDDLY_AUTH0_DOMAIN=kercheval-dev.us.auth0.com
export TIDDLY_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=upLOqYelIdJIv7yZ8AnULA6VGklzak18
export TIDDLY_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=bookmarks-api

bin/tiddly logout 2>/dev/null || true
bin/tiddly login
bin/tiddly auth status      # should show 'Auth method: oauth' + your dev email
```

Then **launch Claude Code from this same terminal** so the agent's Bash tool inherits these env vars.

---

## Deferred / not-covered-here

These behaviors are verified by Go unit tests (`make cli-verify`), not this procedure:

| Behavior | Test name |
|---|---|
| OAuth tokens revoked after commit-phase write failure | `TestRunConfigure__oauth_commit_failure_revokes_minted_tokens` |
| Revoke failure lists orphan names + first-12 prefix | `TestRunConfigure__oauth_commit_failure_with_revoke_failure_surfaces_orphans` |
| Cleanup context detached from cancelled caller context | `TestRevokeMintedTokens__cancelled_context_fails_every_delete` + `__fresh_context_revokes_cleanly` |
| Backup path surfaced when write fails | `TestRunConfigure__commit_phase_failure_surfaces_backup_path` |
| Backup O_EXCL collision retry preserves both files | `TestBackupConfigFile__collision_retry_preserves_both` |
| Partial-result contract (commit-phase vs. preflight) | `TestRunConfigure__commit_phase_failure_preserves_earlier_writes` + `__preflight_failure_returns_nil_result` |
| classifyServer security invariant (URL wins over name) | `TestClassifyServer__routes_by_url` |
| OtherServer.URL round-trips for mismatch detection | `TestClassifyServer__canonical_name_at_non_tiddly_url_records_url` |
| DeleteTokensByPrefix dedupes by PAT + fans out per-entry | `TestDeleteTokensByPrefix__*` |
| Hard-error ordering in preflight | `TestRunConfigure__hard_error_on_*` |
| `canonicalEntryPATs` rejects cross-wired PATs | `TestRunConfigure__does_not_reuse_pat_from_cross_wired_canonical_slot` |
| `--force` log only fires after PAT resolution succeeds | `TestRunConfigure__force_log_not_emitted_when_pat_resolution_fails` |
| Mismatch error has no double "Error:" prefix under cobra | `TestMCPConfigure__mismatch_error_has_no_double_error_prefix` |

Run `make cli-verify` before this procedure.

## Tips for the agent (Bash-per-call model)

The Claude Code Bash tool spawns a fresh shell per call. Functions, variables, and traps from prior calls don't survive. Practical consequences:

- **You (the agent) have memory; the shell does not.** Phase 0 creates a backup directory and a test project directory. Remember these paths and pass them as env exports at the top of every subsequent call. A convenient idiom: begin each call with an `export BACKUP_DIR=...`, `export TEST_PROJECT=...` block listing the paths you need.
- **Source `lib.sh` if you want its helpers in a given call.** It's a small utility file; sourcing is idempotent and side-effect free.
- **Known shell quirks you'll hit on macOS zsh:**
  - `$var[...]` adjacent to `[` is parsed as array-subscript syntax. Use `${var}[...]` or write the value to a file first.
  - `grep -q` inside a pipeline under `set -o pipefail` can exit 141 (SIGPIPE) on large inputs. Prefer `grep PATTERN >/dev/null` or grep against a file.
  - `grep -F "--foo"` treats `--foo` as grep's own flags. Use `grep -F -- "--foo"`.
- **Large CLI output (dry-run diffs can be 100 KB+) is more reliable written to a file than captured into `$(cmd)` and echoed.**

These aren't rules; they're landmines worth stepping around.

---

# Phase 0: Setup

**Behavioral goal:** produce a sandboxed starting state —
 - real configs backed up to a dedicated directory (mode 0700),
 - canonical `tiddly_*` entries sanitized out of live configs so tests never operate on the user's real tokens,
 - pre-existing `cli-mcp-*` token IDs snapshotted for later diff-based cleanup,
 - an empty test-project directory for directory-scope tests,
 - a live markdown report the agent appends to throughout the run.

The block below is a **reference implementation** of the setup. Run it as-is if it works in your environment; adapt it freely if something doesn't (see [§ When something goes wrong](#when-something-goes-wrong)). The behavioral goals above are what matter; the exact bash is one way to reach them. **Remember the `BACKUP_DIR` and `TEST_PROJECT` paths it prints** — you'll export them at the top of every subsequent call.

```bash
set -euo pipefail

# ---- 1. Localhost / auth preflight ---------------------------------------

# Phase 1: Read-only verification

No mutations, no server-state changes.

### T1.1 — Help surfaces

`bin/tiddly --help`, `mcp --help`, `skills --help` all exit 0 and the output lists the expected subcommands and flags.

- Root help: subcommands `login`, `logout`, `auth`, `status`, `mcp`, `skills`, `tokens`; global flags `--token`, `--api-url`.
- `mcp --help`: subcommands `configure`, `status`, `remove`.
- `skills --help`: subcommands `configure`, `list`.

### T1.3 — `mcp configure --help` content

Exit 0. Help text lists the flags `--dry-run`, `--scope`, `--expires`, `--servers`, `--force`; valid args `claude-desktop`, `claude-code`, `codex`. The help text mentions:

- The CLI-managed entry names (`tiddly_notes_bookmarks`, `tiddly_prompts`) and that other entries are preserved (e.g. the example entry `work_prompts`).
- `--force` as the override for URL-mismatch refusal.
- `.bak.<timestamp>` backup filenames.

It does **not** mention `--yes` / `-y` (removed with the additive-configure rework) and does **not** contain the words "consolidate" / "consolidation" / "migrations from manual setups are safe".

### T1.5 — `status` overview

`bin/tiddly status` exits 0 and its output contains the sections `Tiddly CLI v`, `Authentication:`, `API:`, `MCP Servers:`, `Skills:`. The header is exactly `MCP Servers:` (no `(path: ...)` suffix when `--path` isn't passed). Each detected tool appears; undetected tools are labeled `Not detected`. Any configured row ends with `(<config_key_name>)` in parentheses showing the on-disk entry name.

With `--path "$TEST_PROJECT"`, the header becomes `MCP Servers (path: $TEST_PROJECT):`.

With `--path /nonexistent/path`, the command exits non-zero and the error mentions "does not exist".

### T1.6 — `auth status`

Exit 0. Output contains `Auth method:` (one of `pat` / `oauth` / `flag` / `env`) and `API URL:`.

### T1.7 — `tokens list` output contract

This is a **contract lock** — Phase 0's token snapshot and Phase 9's cleanup both parse `tokens list` assuming the ID is column 1. A silent column reorder or header rename would silently break cleanup.

The header row contains the substrings `ID`, `NAME`, and `PREFIX`, in that order (`NAME` appears before `PREFIX`), plus an `EXPIRES` column (T2.8 depends on that column existing). Column 1 under the header is the token ID.

---

# Phase 2: Configure — happy paths

Starts mutating live config files. The CLI takes `.bak.<timestamp>` sibling backups; Phase 0 also holds originals in `$BACKUP_DIR`.

### T2.1 — claude-code, user scope (default)

`bin/tiddly mcp configure claude-code` exits 0 and:

- Stdout contains `Configured: claude-code`.
- **If** a pre-existing `$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG` was present, stdout also contains a `Backed up claude-code config to <path>` line (exact prefix; `<path>` is the `.bak.<timestamp>` sibling the CLI created). That path exists on disk, has the pre-command SHA, and preserves the source's file mode. If no prior config existed, no `Backed up` line is emitted — that's `backupConfigFile`'s documented behavior (`cli/internal/mcp/config_io.go`), not a defect.
- `$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG` now has `.mcpServers.tiddly_notes_bookmarks` with `type: "http"`, `url` matching `$TIDDLY_CONTENT_MCP_URL`, and `headers.Authorization` starting with `Bearer bm_`.
- Same for `.mcpServers.tiddly_prompts` at `$TIDDLY_PROMPT_MCP_URL`.
- No pre-existing `mcpServers` key disappeared (diff the key set before/after; only `tiddly_*` keys should be new, everything else unchanged).

**Do the URL / header checks with `jq -e` exit codes, not by printing values.** See [§ Never echo plaintext Bearer values](#never-echo-plaintext-bearer-values).

### T2.2 — `--servers content` preserves prompts

`bin/tiddly mcp configure claude-code --servers content` exits 0. After, both `tiddly_notes_bookmarks` (written) and `tiddly_prompts` (preserved from T2.1) are present in `$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG`.

### T2.3 — `--servers prompts` preserves content

Symmetric to T2.2 — both entries present afterward.

### T2.4 — claude-code, directory scope

In `$TEST_PROJECT`, `$TIDDLY_BIN mcp configure claude-code --scope directory` exits 0. `$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG` now has both entries under `.projects["$TEST_PROJECT"].mcpServers`. The top-level `.mcpServers` key set is unchanged (i.e. user-scope state wasn't modified).

### T2.5 — Codex, user scope

`bin/tiddly mcp configure codex` exits 0, takes a backup of the existing TOML, and writes `[mcp_servers.tiddly_notes_bookmarks]` (with `url = ...` and `[mcp_servers.tiddly_notes_bookmarks.http_headers]` containing `Authorization = "Bearer bm_..."`) and the analogous section for `tiddly_prompts`. Existing non-Tiddly top-level sections are preserved.

**TOML parsing tip:** `uv run python3 -c 'import tomllib; ...'` works on Python 3.11+ (project uses `uv` — see [§ Prerequisites](#prerequisites)). Use exit-code assertions without printing values (same hygiene as JSON).

### T2.6 — Codex, directory scope

In `$TEST_PROJECT`, `$TIDDLY_BIN mcp configure codex --scope directory` creates `$TEST_PROJECT/.codex/config.toml` with both canonical entries. The user-scope `$CODEX_CONFIG` is byte-identical before and after (SHA compare).

### T2.7 — Claude Desktop, user scope

`bin/tiddly mcp configure claude-desktop` exits 0 and writes to the Claude Desktop config a stdio-launcher shape: `.mcpServers.tiddly_notes_bookmarks` has `command: "npx"` and an `args` array that contains `"mcp-remote"`, `$TIDDLY_CONTENT_MCP_URL`, and a `"Authorization: Bearer bm_..."` header arg. Same shape for `tiddly_prompts`. Stderr contains `Warning: Restart Claude Desktop to apply changes.` (note the `Warning:` prefix — configure uses the `ConfigureResult.Warnings` channel).

### T2.8 — `--expires 30` sets expiration ~30 days out

Starting from a clean slate (e.g. `mcp remove claude-code --delete-tokens` first), `bin/tiddly mcp configure claude-code --expires 30` prints `Created tokens: cli-mcp-claude-code-*` (not `Reused`). In `tokens list` the new tokens' `EXPIRES` column holds a date roughly 30 days out (accept a ±1 day window for clock skew).

**Parsing tip:** filter to `cli-mcp-` data rows first, then parse. In a **data** row, EXPIRES is `$5` under default awk (whitespace-splitting): data rows have exactly 6 single-token fields — `LAST USED` is always an ISO date like `2026-05-21` or the em-dash `—`, one token either way. Avoid parsing the **header** row: its `LAST USED` has an internal space that makes `awk` see 7 words, so counting by header position is fragile (the em-dash `—` is also multi-byte UTF-8, so any byte-offset parsing is off).

### T2.9 — Auto-detect

`bin/tiddly mcp configure` (no tool arg) exits 0, lists every detected tool under `Configured:`, and each tool's config is updated.

### T2.10 — Status row format after configure

`bin/tiddly status` shows each Tiddly row ending with `(tiddly_notes_bookmarks)` or `(tiddly_prompts)` — the actual config key matches what's on disk. Multiple scopes render cleanly.

### T2.11 — Additive configure preserves non-CLI-managed entries

Headline of the additive-configure rework. Given an existing config with non-canonical Tiddly entries (`work_prompts` and `personal_prompts`, each with its own PAT), `configure` adds the canonical CLI-managed entries alongside them and names the preserved entries.

Set up the fixture:

1. Mint two PATs via `tiddly tokens create cli-mcp-test-t2-11-...`.
2. Write both as non-CLI-managed entries in `$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG` (pointing at `$TIDDLY_PROMPT_MCP_URL`). The `write_multi_entry_prompts` helper in `lib.sh` does this.
3. Run `bin/tiddly mcp configure claude-code`.

After:

- Exit 0.
- Stdout contains `Preserved non-CLI-managed entries in claude-code:` followed by both `work_prompts` and `personal_prompts` (order-independent).
- `jq`: `tiddly_prompts` added; `work_prompts` and `personal_prompts` survived.
- Stdout does **not** say `consolidate` / `Consolidation required` (that gate is gone).
- Remember to `unset` any plaintext PAT variables after the fixture write.

### T2.12 — Canonical update-in-place: no churn on re-run

Running `configure` twice in a row against an already-correctly-configured state must not churn tokens or rewrite the canonical entries. Under OAuth, existing PATs are validated and reused; under PAT auth, the login PAT is rewritten identically. Either way the bytes don't change.

1. Ensure a known-good state: `bin/tiddly mcp configure claude-code`.
2. Snapshot the canonical entries' JSON (hash `jq -c '.mcpServers.tiddly_notes_bookmarks'` and `.tiddly_prompts` separately).
3. Run `configure claude-code` again.
4. Re-hash. Both hashes must match exactly.

Stdout contains `Configured: claude-code`, no `unexpected URL` refusal.

The OAuth-vs-PAT outcome differs textually — under OAuth stdout says `Reused tokens:`; under PAT auth it does not (login PAT is used directly). Either path is correct. Worth recording in the report as a NOTE-line for log readability.

### T2.13 — `--force` overwrites a canonical entry at a non-Tiddly URL

A user hand-edited `tiddly_prompts` to point somewhere else (e.g. `https://example.com/my-prompts`). Default configure refuses; `--force` overwrites and logs the per-entry forcing line to **stderr**.

1. Seed a non-Tiddly URL on `.mcpServers.tiddly_prompts` via `jq`.
2. Run `configure claude-code`. Expected: non-zero exit; **stderr** contains `1 CLI-managed entry` (singular) + `has an unexpected URL` + `tiddly_prompts → https://example.com/my-prompts` + `re-run with --force`. (The mismatch error is a `RunE` return; cobra is configured with `SilenceErrors: true`, so `main.go` prints it to `os.Stderr` — none of it lands on stdout. Capture with e.g. `2>/tmp/stderr_refuse`.) **Before** the next command, snapshot the on-disk URL — it must still be the bad one (default refusal must not write). Do the snapshot in-band; asserting against the live file post-`--force` is meaningless because `--force` overwrites it.
3. Run `configure claude-code --force`, routing stderr separately (e.g. `... 2>/tmp/stderr_force`). Expected: exit 0; **stderr** (not stdout) contains `Forcing overwrite of tiddly_prompts (currently https://example.com/my-prompts)`; stdout contains `Configured: claude-code`; the live file's `tiddly_prompts.url` is now `$TIDDLY_PROMPT_MCP_URL`.

After, restore a clean state for subsequent phases: `mcp remove claude-code --delete-tokens; mcp configure claude-code`. Use `--delete-tokens` on the remove so the previous run's PATs are revoked before fresh ones are minted — otherwise every restore-clean-state incantation across T2.13 / T3.7 / T3.8 leaks two live tokens server-side, which accumulates across the run and can hit the tier token cap.

---

# Phase 3: Dry-run

No config writes; no server mutations.

### T3.1 — Dry-run, claude-code, user scope

`bin/tiddly mcp configure claude-code --dry-run` exits 0. Its output contains the banner `--- claude-code ---`, a `File:` line, and either `Before:` + `After:` sections or a `(new file)` marker. Both `tiddly_notes_bookmarks` and `tiddly_prompts` appear in the diff.

The SHA of `$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG` is unchanged before vs. after the command. The token count from `tokens list` is unchanged.

**Under PAT auth** (not OAuth), stderr contains `Using your current token for MCP servers`. Under OAuth, this advisory is absent.

**Tip:** the dry-run diff can dump a large real `~/.claude.json` (often 100 KB+). Redirect stdout to a file rather than capturing into a shell variable and echoing — `$(cmd)`-then-`echo` on large blobs is shell- flaky across zsh/bash.

### T3.2 — Dry-run, directory scope

`$TIDDLY_BIN mcp configure claude-code --scope directory --dry-run` (run from `$TEST_PROJECT`) shows the diff under the project-path key. `$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG` unchanged.

### T3.3 — Dry-run placeholder for would-be tokens

After ensuring no existing PATs to reuse (`mcp remove claude-code --delete-tokens`, which covers the clean case), `mcp configure claude-code --dry-run` shows `<new-token-would-be-created>` in the `After:` section. The `tokens list` count is unchanged (no tokens actually minted).

### T3.4 — Dry-run, Codex

`bin/tiddly mcp configure codex --dry-run` shows `--- codex ---` banner and TOML-format `Before:` / `After:`. `$CODEX_CONFIG` unchanged.

### T3.5 — Dry-run, Claude Desktop

Analogous: `--- claude-desktop ---` banner; `After:` section includes `npx` and `mcp-remote`. Config unchanged.

### T3.6 — Dry-run does NOT emit the real-run summary line

`bin/tiddly mcp configure claude-code --dry-run` output does not contain `Configured: claude-code` — the summary line is gated on non-dry-run. The banner and diff are the dry-run signal.

### T3.7 — Dry-run on a URL-mismatch warns but does not abort

**Setup:** re-seed the T2.13 fixture — T2.13 ends by restoring clean state, so the bad URL is gone at this point. `jq`-overwrite `.mcpServers.tiddly_prompts` to a non-Tiddly URL like `https://example.com/my-prompts` (a fresh canonical-shaped entry with `type: "http"`, the bad URL, and any well-formed `headers.Authorization: "Bearer bm_..."` value). Then:

- `mcp configure claude-code --dry-run` exits 0 (dry-run is tolerant of mismatches — a real run would fail-closed).
- **Stderr** (not stdout) contains `Warning: tiddly_prompts at https://example.com/my-prompts — real run will require --force`.
- **Stdout** contains the normal dry-run diff.
- `$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG` is unchanged.

### T3.8 — Dry-run + `--force` suppresses the warning, shows the overwrite

With the same non-Tiddly-URL state, `mcp configure claude-code --dry-run --force` exits 0.

- **Stderr** does NOT contain `real run will require --force` (warning suppressed under `--force`).
- **Stderr** does NOT contain `Forcing overwrite of` (that log is non-dry-run only).
- **Stdout** contains the canonical prompts URL so the user can see what the real-run overwrite would write.
- `$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG` unchanged.

After, restore a clean state for subsequent phases: `mcp remove claude-code --delete-tokens; mcp configure claude-code` (same `--delete-tokens` rationale as T2.13's restore).

---

# Phase 4: Status

### T4.1 — Status across tools (default path)

`bin/tiddly mcp status` exits 0 and renders a per-tool tree. For scopes with no Tiddly entries: the output contains `No Tiddly servers configured. Run '` followed by a hint like `tiddly mcp configure claude-code`. For scopes with Tiddly entries: server rows end with `(<config_key>)`. Header is `MCP Servers:`.

### T4.2 — Status with explicit `--path`

`bin/tiddly mcp status --path "$TEST_PROJECT"` has the header `MCP Servers (path: $TEST_PROJECT):`. The claude-code directory-scope section shows an annotation indicating that directory-scope entries are stored in the user-scope file (`~/.claude.json`) under a `projects` subsection keyed by the project path (i.e. it makes the user-scope-file-with-project-subkey storage model visible in the output).

<!-- T4.3 intentionally omitted — invalid-path handling for `status --path` is covered by T1.5's shared-validator check; duplicating it here would test the same code path twice. -->

### T4.4 — Multi-entry rendered as multiple rows (KAN-112 regression)

After setting up `work_prompts` and `personal_prompts` (as in T2.11), `bin/tiddly mcp status` renders **each as its own row** under the claude-code prompts section — not folded under one "prompts" node. Both rows have the `(work_prompts)` and `(personal_prompts)` suffixes visible. Neither row appears under an "Other servers" section.

**Tip:** `mcp status` prefixes tree rows with `│` (U+2502 box-drawing), which isn't POSIX whitespace. Anchor greps on the trailing `(<name>)` suffix, not on leading whitespace.

After, reconfigure and then sweep any accumulated `cli-mcp-test-*` PATs to stay under the tier token cap (see the inline sweep snippet at the end of [§ Phase 5](#phase-5-remove)).

---

# Phase 5: Remove

### T5.1 — Remove claude-code, user scope

`bin/tiddly mcp configure claude-code` then `bin/tiddly mcp remove claude-code`: exit 0, stdout contains `Removed tiddly_notes_bookmarks, tiddly_prompts from claude-code.` and a `Backed up previous config to <path>` line. The reported backup path exists and its SHA matches the pre-remove SHA. Both canonical entries are gone from the live config; other entries preserved. Stderr may contain an orphan-token warning.

### T5.2 — Remove claude-code, directory scope

Configure then remove `--scope directory` from within `$TEST_PROJECT`. The `.projects["$TEST_PROJECT"].mcpServers` object has no `tiddly_*` keys; top-level `.mcpServers` is unchanged.

### T5.3 — Remove Codex

Configure then remove `codex`. Stdout: `Removed tiddly_notes_bookmarks, tiddly_prompts from codex.` The TOML has no `tiddly_*` tables.

### T5.4 — Remove Claude Desktop

Configure then remove `claude-desktop`. Stdout: `Removed tiddly_notes_bookmarks, tiddly_prompts from claude-desktop.` Stderr contains `Restart Claude Desktop to apply changes.` (note: this flavor is bare, without the `Warning:` prefix that the configure path adds — this asymmetry is the actual product behavior; record as informational).

### T5.5 — Remove `--servers content` is partial

Configure claude-code, then `mcp remove claude-code --servers content`. `tiddly_notes_bookmarks` removed; `tiddly_prompts` still present.

### T5.6 — Remove `--servers prompts` is partial

Symmetric to T5.5.

### T5.7 — Remove `--delete-tokens` (clean single-entry case)

Clean install: `mcp remove claude-code` to clear, then `mcp configure claude-code` (note the `Created tokens: cli-mcp-...` names), then `mcp remove claude-code --delete-tokens`. Stdout contains `Deleted tokens:` listing those same names. `tokens list` confirms they are gone server-side.

### T5.8 — Remove `--delete-tokens` preserves non-CLI-managed entries and their PATs (headline)

The canonical-name-only remove contract: revoking CLI-managed tokens must not touch user-managed entries or their PATs.

Fixture setup:

1. Mint four PATs with clearly scoped names: `cli-mcp-test-t5-8-content-*`, `-prompts-*`, `-work-*`, `-personal-*`.
2. Fresh `mcp remove claude-code`.
3. Write `work_prompts` / `personal_prompts` via `write_multi_entry_prompts` (with the work + personal PATs).
4. Write **full** canonical entries into `$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG` via `jq` — not just header overwrites. The revoke path in `mcp remove` only extracts a PAT for revocation if the entry's URL classifies as a Tiddly MCP URL (see `cli/internal/mcp/claude_code.go`'s `isTiddlyContentURL` / `isTiddlyPromptURL`). So each canonical entry must include `type: "http"`, the correct Tiddly URL, **and** the PAT in `headers.Authorization`:
   - `tiddly_notes_bookmarks` → `url: $TIDDLY_CONTENT_MCP_URL`, `Authorization: "Bearer $PAT_CONTENT_58"`.
   - `tiddly_prompts`         → `url: $TIDDLY_PROMPT_MCP_URL`, `Authorization: "Bearer $PAT_PROMPTS_58"`.
   Wrong URL here means the revoke path never sees the PAT, the assertion false-fails, and you'll misclassify a correct product as a bug.
5. Record which of the four test-token IDs exist.
6. Run `mcp remove claude-code --delete-tokens`.

After:

- Exit 0. Stdout contains `Removed tiddly_notes_bookmarks, tiddly_prompts from claude-code.` and `Deleted tokens:` listing **exactly** the content + prompts test tokens (not work / personal).
- Server-side: the content + prompts PATs are gone from `tokens list`; work + personal PATs remain.
- Live config: `work_prompts` and `personal_prompts` entries still present; `tiddly_*` entries gone.

### T5.8b — Shared-PAT consolidated warning

Scenario: a canonical entry being revoked shares its PAT with one or more retained (non-CLI-managed) entries. The warning fires as **one consolidated line per revoking entry**, listing every retained entry that shares its PAT, sorted alphabetically.

Fixture shape:

- `tiddly_notes_bookmarks` with its own distinct PAT (must NOT appear in the warning).
- `tiddly_prompts`, `work_prompts`, `personal_prompts` all sharing a single PAT.

Concrete recipe (one way to build this — adapt if your shell differs):

```bash
bin/tiddly mcp remove claude-code --delete-tokens 2>/dev/null || true
uniq=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
PAT_CONTENT=$(bin/tiddly tokens create "cli-mcp-test-shared-content-$uniq" 2>&1 | awk '/^  bm_/ {print $1}')
PAT_SHARED=$(bin/tiddly tokens create  "cli-mcp-test-shared-$uniq"         2>&1 | awk '/^  bm_/ {print $1}')
[ -n "$PAT_CONTENT" ] && [ -n "$PAT_SHARED" ] || { echo "FATAL: T5.8b token mint failed"; exit 1; }

[ -f "$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG" ] || echo "{}" > "$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG"
jq --arg curl "$TIDDLY_CONTENT_MCP_URL" --arg purl "$TIDDLY_PROMPT_MCP_URL" \
   --arg content "$PAT_CONTENT" --arg shared "$PAT_SHARED" \
   '.mcpServers = (.mcpServers // {})
    | .mcpServers.tiddly_notes_bookmarks = {type:"http", url:$curl, headers:{Authorization:("Bearer "+$content)}}
    | .mcpServers.tiddly_prompts         = {type:"http", url:$purl, headers:{Authorization:("Bearer "+$shared)}}
    | .mcpServers.work_prompts           = {type:"http", url:$purl, headers:{Authorization:("Bearer "+$shared)}}
    | .mcpServers.personal_prompts       = {type:"http", url:$purl, headers:{Authorization:("Bearer "+$shared)}}' \
   "$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG" > "$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG.tmp" && mv "$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG.tmp" "$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG"
chmod 0600 "$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG"
unset PAT_CONTENT PAT_SHARED uniq      # consume immediately; no PAT lingers in the shell
```

Then run `mcp remove claude-code --servers prompts --delete-tokens`:

- Exit 0.
- **Stderr** contains exactly: `Warning: token from tiddly_prompts is also used by personal_prompts, work_prompts (still configured); revoking will break those bindings.` The retained names are comma-joined, alphabetically sorted (→ `personal_prompts` before `work_prompts`).
- **Stderr** does NOT name `tiddly_notes_bookmarks` (its PAT is not shared with the revoke target).
- Stdout contains `Deleted tokens:`.
- Canonical prompts entry removed; `work_prompts` / `personal_prompts` entries preserved (their PATs are now dead, but the entries themselves are still in the config).

**Note:** this test intentionally leaves `work_prompts` and `personal_prompts` with a revoked PAT. T5.9 explicitly wipes those residuals before running (see the reset step just below T5.8d).

### T5.8c — `--delete-tokens` note when PAT doesn't match any CLI-minted token

Scenario: the canonical `tiddly_prompts` entry holds a PAT that was created via `tokens create` but with a name that **doesn't** match the `cli-mcp-*` pattern (e.g. `manual-test-pat-<hex>`). The CLI cannot revoke it (by name-prefix matching), but it must surface a per-entry explanation.

Fixture: fresh configure, then `jq`-overwrite `tiddly_prompts`'s Authorization with the manually-named PAT. **Mint the manual token with a unique suffix** (e.g. `uniq=$(openssl rand -hex 3); bin/tiddly tokens create "manual-test-pat-$uniq"`) and record `$uniq` — you need it for precise cleanup at the end of the test.

Run `mcp remove claude-code --servers prompts --delete-tokens`:

- Exit 0.
- **Stdout** (outcome report, not warning) contains: `Note: no CLI-created token matched the token attached to tiddly_prompts; nothing was revoked. Manage tokens at https://tiddly.me/settings.`
- Stdout does NOT contain `Deleted tokens:`.

**Cleanup (required).** The manually-named token won't match Phase 9's `cli-mcp-*` diff-cleanup filter, so revoke it explicitly before moving on. Look it up by **exact name equality** — not a prefix match — to avoid grabbing a leaked `manual-test-pat-*` token from a prior aborted run:

```bash
manual_id=$(bin/tiddly tokens list 2>/dev/null | awk -v nm="manual-test-pat-$uniq" '$2 == nm {print $1; exit}')
[ -n "$manual_id" ] && bin/tiddly tokens delete "$manual_id" --force
```

### T5.8d — Orphan-warning filter excludes tokens still referenced by retained entries

Scenario: after `configure`, copy the `tiddly_prompts` PAT into a new `work_prompts` entry so the CLI-minted PAT is still in active use. Then run `mcp remove claude-code` **without** `--delete-tokens`. The orphan-warning path fires, but the still-in-use PAT must NOT appear in the warning.

**Recommended fixture idiom** — in-place `jq` rewrite that copies the prompts PAT to `work_prompts` without ever landing the plaintext in a shell variable:

```bash
bin/tiddly mcp configure claude-code >/dev/null
jq '.mcpServers.work_prompts = {
      type: "http",
      url: env.TIDDLY_PROMPT_MCP_URL,
      headers: .mcpServers.tiddly_prompts.headers
    }' "$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG" > "$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG.tmp" && mv "$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG.tmp" "$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG"
chmod 0600 "$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG"
# No captured token — no `echo`/`set -x` leak surface.
```

Then run `mcp remove claude-code` (no `--delete-tokens`) and assert:

- **Stderr** does NOT contain a `Warning: PATs created for claude-code may still exist:` line that names the prompts token (either no warning at all, or a warning that covers only the content token).
- `tokens list` still shows the prompts token.
- `work_prompts` entry survives the remove.

**Reset before T5.9.** T5.8b left `work_prompts` and `personal_prompts` in the config (with a revoked PAT); T5.8d overwrites `work_prompts` and leaves `personal_prompts` alone. `configure`/`remove` are canonical-only and will not clear those — so explicitly wipe them now so T5.9 runs against a true clean slate:

```bash
jq 'del(.mcpServers.work_prompts, .mcpServers.personal_prompts)' "$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG" > "$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG.tmp" && mv "$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG.tmp" "$CLAUDE_CODE_CONFIG"
```

This is on-disk only — server-side PAT cleanup (for the CLI-minted token now orphaned in `tokens list` after T5.8d's removal) is deferred to Phase 8/9's diff-based sweep, which handles it by design.

### T5.9 — Remove without `--delete-tokens` — orphan warning

Configure, then remove (no `--delete-tokens`).

- **Stderr** contains `Warning: PATs created for claude-code may still exist:` followed by `cli-mcp-*` names (don't assert on exact names — environment-dependent).
- **Stderr** contains `Run 'tiddly mcp remove claude-code --delete-tokens' to revoke` (the tool name is interpolated, not a `<tool>` placeholder).

### T5.10 — Remove idempotent — no-op path

After T5.9, re-running `mcp remove claude-code` exits 0. Stdout contains `No CLI-managed entries found in claude-code.` Stdout does NOT contain `Removed tiddly_notes_bookmarks` (the CLI distinguishes "removed something" from "nothing to remove" and must not lie).

### End-of-phase housekeeping

Sweep accumulated `cli-mcp-test-*` tokens so later phases don't blow the tier token cap. These test-only PATs are named with a reserved `cli-mcp-test-` prefix; sweep them specifically, never the `cli-mcp-<tool>-<server>-*` names (those are minted by `configure` and may still be referenced by live configs). One pass with `tokens list` filtered on `cli-mcp-test-` + `tokens delete <id> --force` is enough. Verify `bin/tiddly auth status` still shows `oauth` before proceeding.

---

# Phase 6: Skills

No structural changes in this round; included for completeness.

### T6.1 — Skills configure, claude-code, user scope

`bin/tiddly skills configure claude-code` exits 0. The CLI prints `cfgResult.DestPath` verbatim (`cli/cmd/skills.go`) and the resolver returns an **absolute** path for user scope (`$HOME/.claude/skills`, no tilde). So output is either `claude-code: Configured N skill(s) to <absolute-home>/.claude/skills` (e.g. `/Users/you/.claude/skills`) or `claude-code: No skills to configure.` — both valid depending on how many prompts are tagged. Files land at `$CLAUDE_SKILLS_DIR` on disk.

### T6.2 — Claude-code, directory scope

In `$TEST_PROJECT`: `$TIDDLY_BIN skills configure claude-code --scope directory`. For directory scope the resolver returns the **relative** path `.claude/skills` — so the output reads `claude-code: Configured N skill(s) to .claude/skills` (no tilde, no `$TEST_PROJECT` prefix). Files land at `$TEST_PROJECT/.claude/skills/` because that's the cwd the relative path resolves against.

### T6.3 — Codex, user scope

`bin/tiddly skills configure codex` exits 0. Output either `codex: Configured N skill(s) to <absolute-home>/.agents/skills` (absolute path, no tilde) or `codex: No skills to configure.`

### T6.4 — Codex, directory scope

`$TIDDLY_BIN skills configure codex --scope directory` from `$TEST_PROJECT`: output contains the relative `.agents/skills` (no `$TEST_PROJECT` prefix in the text). Files extracted to `$TEST_PROJECT/.agents/skills/` on disk.

### T6.5 — Claude Desktop, user scope (zip export)

`bin/tiddly skills configure claude-desktop` exits 0. If skills exist, output mentions a zip path ending in `tiddly-skills-*.zip` plus the hint `Upload this file to Claude Desktop via Settings > Skills.` The zip lands in `os.TempDir()` — on macOS that's `$TMPDIR` (usually under `/var/folders/.../T/`), not `/tmp`. Don't pin the `/tmp` prefix; match on the filename pattern.

### T6.6 — `--tags` filter, default `match=all`

`skills configure claude-code --tags python,skill` installs exactly the set of prompts whose tags include **both** `python` AND `skill`.

**Before running,** wipe the skills dir: `rm -rf "$CLAUDE_SKILLS_DIR"`. Phase 0's sanitize cleared it at session start, but T6.1 has since installed skills (which `skills configure` doesn't remove on re-run; see `cli/cmd/skills.go:52`). A stale directory poisons the equality compare.

**Verify with exact set equality** — compute the expected set client-side by replaying the backend's filter + normalize logic:

1. `bin/tiddly export --types prompt` gives full prompt metadata (including tag lists).
2. Filter to prompts whose tags contain both `python` and `skill`.
3. Truncate each matching `.name` to the client's `name_max` (64 for claude-code). Mirror's the backend's `prompt.name[:64]` in `backend/src/services/skill_converter.py`.
4. Collect into a **set** (e.g. `jq ... | sort -u`) — set semantics mean that if two prompts collide at the truncated name, they collapse to one entry, matching the backend's `_build_skills_dict` last-one-wins dedup (since we only care about membership here, we don't need to replay "which content won").

Then compare the expected set against `ls -1 "$CLAUDE_SKILLS_DIR" | sort -u`. The two must be **equal**, not just subset-related, and non-empty (otherwise an all-empty compare false-passes).

One way to do this (adapt if `jq` / field shape differs in your environment):

```bash
rm -rf "$CLAUDE_SKILLS_DIR"
bin/tiddly skills configure claude-code --tags python,skill >/dev/null 2>&1
export_json=$(mktemp)
bin/tiddly export --types prompt > "$export_json" 2>/dev/null
expected=$(jq -r '
    .prompts // []
    | map(select((.tags // []) as $t | ($t | index("python")) and ($t | index("skill"))))
    | map(.name[0:64])
    | unique
    | .[]
' "$export_json" | LC_ALL=C sort)
rm -f "$export_json"
installed=$(ls -1 "$CLAUDE_SKILLS_DIR" 2>/dev/null | LC_ALL=C sort)
# Assertions:
#   - $expected and $installed are non-empty (otherwise SKIP)
#   - $expected == $installed (exact set equality)
```

If `$expected` is empty, SKIP with "no prompts in dev DB match both python+skill tags."

**Note:** `jq`'s string slicing is codepoint-based, matching the backend's Python `name[:64]` slicing — so membership equality holds regardless of whether prompt names contain multibyte characters. (Earlier revisions of this doc warned of a byte-vs-codepoint mismatch; that was wrong — `jq -n '"😀abc"|.[0:1]'` returns `"😀"` intact.)

Snapshot the T6.6 `$installed` into `t76_installed` for T6.7's superset check.

### T6.7 — `--tag-match any`

`--tag-match any` installs prompts matching **at least one** of the tags. Same structure as T6.6, with two changes:

1. Filter predicate uses OR instead of AND: `($t | index("python")) or ($t | index("skill"))`.
2. Wipe the dir first (same rationale as T6.6): `rm -rf "$CLAUDE_SKILLS_DIR"`.

Assert exact set equality between the normalized expected set and `$installed`, same as T6.6. Additionally assert T6.7's `$installed` is a **superset** of T6.6's: `comm -23 <(echo "$t76_installed") <(echo "$installed")` is empty (every T6.6 name appears in T6.7).

### T6.8 — Auto-detect

`bin/tiddly skills configure` exits 0, one output line per detected tool.

### T6.9 — Invalid scope

`skills configure --scope invalid` exits non-zero; error contains `invalid scope "invalid". Valid scopes: user, directory`.

### T6.10 — Skills list

`bin/tiddly skills list` exits 0. Output starts with `Available skills (N prompts):` or `No prompts found.`

### T6.11 — Skills list with tag filter

`bin/tiddly skills list --tags python` exits 0, lists only `python`-tagged prompts.

# Phase 7: Error handling

Pure validation-failure cases; no side effects on configs or tokens.

| Test | Command | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| T7.1 | `mcp configure invalid-tool` | non-zero; `unknown tool "invalid-tool". Valid tools: claude-desktop, claude-code, codex` |
| T7.2 | `mcp remove invalid-tool` | non-zero; same error text |
| T7.3 | `mcp configure claude-code --scope bad-scope` | non-zero; `invalid scope "bad-scope". Valid scopes: user, directory` |
| T7.4 | `mcp configure claude-code --scope local` | non-zero; `invalid scope "local". Valid scopes: user, directory` |
| T7.5 | `mcp configure claude-code --scope project` | non-zero; `invalid scope "project". Valid scopes: user, directory` |
| T7.6 | `mcp configure claude-code --servers invalid` | non-zero; `invalid server "invalid" in --servers flag. Valid values: content, prompts` |
| T7.7 | `mcp configure claude-code --servers ""` | non-zero; `--servers flag requires at least one value: content, prompts` |
| T7.8 | `mcp configure claude-desktop` when Claude Desktop is NOT detected (skip otherwise) | non-zero; `claude-desktop is not installed on this system` |
| T7.9 | `skills configure claude-desktop --scope directory` | non-zero; `--scope directory is not supported by: claude-desktop` |
| T7.10 | `login --token "invalid_no_prefix"` | non-zero; `invalid token format: must start with 'bm_'` |
| T7.11 | `login --token "bm_definitely_not_valid_token"` | non-zero; `token verification failed` |

After these, verify `auth status` still shows `oauth` — two failed login attempts shouldn't have mutated credentials.

# Phase 8: Auth / logout

Runs at the end because subsequent phases need auth.

### T8.0 — Cleanup before logout

Before logging out, do the full diff-based cleanup (Phase 9 needs auth alive too, but this test establishes the invariant that no new `cli-mcp-*` token is minted between T8.0 and re-login at T8.3). Diff the current `cli-mcp-*` IDs against `$BACKUP_DIR/cli-mcp-ids-before.txt` and `tokens delete <id> --force` each addition.

Phase 9 re-runs this same cleanup as a safety net (belt-and-suspenders). If the no-new-tokens invariant held between T8.0 and T8.3, Phase 9 revokes zero additional tokens; if anything leaked, Phase 9 catches it.

### T8.1 — `mcp status` works without auth

`bin/tiddly logout`: exit 0, stdout `Logged out successfully.` `bin/tiddly mcp status`: exit 0, MCP tree still renders (read-only command; reads local config only).

### T8.2 — Destructive commands fail when logged out

Each of the following exits non-zero with an error containing `not logged in. Run 'tiddly login' to authenticate`:

- `bin/tiddly mcp configure claude-code`
- `bin/tiddly skills list`
- `bin/tiddly skills configure claude-code`

### T8.3 — Re-login

**Engineer step (manual — device flow):**

```bash
bin/tiddly login
```

**Agent:** `bin/tiddly auth status` → shows `Auth method: oauth` with dev account.

---

# Phase 9: Teardown

Explicit — run this as the last Bash call of the session. The block below is a reference implementation; the behavioral goals are:

- Revoke every `cli-mcp-*` token that appeared during this run (diff against the Phase 0 snapshot; revoke only the additions). Fail-closed — if auth is dead or a token delete fails, stop and preserve `$BACKUP_DIR` so the engineer can finish manually.
- Restore the real config files and skills directories from `$BACKUP_DIR`.
- Sweep CLI-emitted sibling backups (`<config>.bak.*`) that appeared during this run (delta against Phase 0's `siblings-before.txt` snapshot — never destroy pre-existing backups).
- Copy `$REPORT` to a retained location (e.g. `<repo-root>/test-run-<UTC-ts>.md`) **before** deleting `$BACKUP_DIR`.
- Delete `$TEST_PROJECT` and `$BACKUP_DIR` only if every previous step succeeded.

Adapt the bash below as needed. If any step fails, print recovery instructions (at minimum: the `cp -p <backup> <live>` commands the engineer would need to restore manually) and leave `$BACKUP_DIR` on disk.

```bash
set -euo pipefail

# User verification checklist (manual, not automatable)

- Claude Desktop actually connects to MCP servers after configure.
- MCP tools return real data.
- Prompts render through the prompt MCP server.
- Skills are invocable in Claude Code / Codex.
- OAuth device flow works end-to-end (`tiddly login` without `--token`).
- Uploaded skills zip works in Claude Desktop (Settings > Skills).

---

# Reference: known assumptions

Things the procedure quietly relies on. If any of these changes, the run's bookkeeping quietly goes wrong — worth re-reviewing if you touch the surfaces below.

- **`bin/tiddly tokens list` returns all tokens in one response.** No pagination parameter is passed; Phase 0's `cli-mcp-*` snapshot and Phase 9's diff-cleanup both assume the full set is visible in a single call. If `tokens list` ever paginates, both phases need an update to page through.
- **Peak run token count is ~15–25 `cli-mcp-*` tokens.** `cli-mcp-test-*` PATs are swept at the ends of Phases 4 and 5; `cli-mcp-<tool>-<server>-*` PATs minted by `configure` persist until Phase 8's pre-logout cleanup. If your test account's tier cap is tighter than ~30, raise it or use a dedicated test account.
- **The `--delete-tokens` restore idiom in T2.13 and T3.8 is safe because Phase 0 enforces OAuth.** Under PAT auth, revoking the canonical-slot PAT could revoke the session itself; Phase 0's preflight makes that inapplicable here.

---

# Reference: config shapes (one-liner each)

All tests assert via `jq -e` (JSON) or `uv run python3 -c 'import tomllib'` (TOML) with exit-code-only checks — never by printing values.

- **Claude Desktop** (JSON): `.mcpServers.<name> = {command:"npx", args:["mcp-remote", URL, "--header", "Authorization: Bearer bm_..."]}`
- **Claude Code, user scope** (JSON, `~/.claude.json`): `.mcpServers.<name> = {type:"http", url:URL, headers:{Authorization:"Bearer bm_..."}}`
- **Claude Code, directory scope** (same file): same shape under `.projects["<path>"].mcpServers.<name>`
- **Codex** (TOML, `~/.codex/config.toml` or `.codex/config.toml`): `[mcp_servers.<name>]` with `url` + `[mcp_servers.<name>.http_headers]` with `Authorization`

# Reference: backup filename format

Every destructive `configure`/`remove` writes a sibling:

```
<config_path>.bak.<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>        # first backup this UTC second
<config_path>.bak.<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>.1      # collision suffix (.1..1000)
```

Permissions match the source (0600 for files holding PATs). Never overwritten (O_EXCL). Phase 9's teardown sweeps them.

# Reference: key constants

| Constant | Value |
|---|---|
| Content server name | `tiddly_notes_bookmarks` |
| Prompts server name | `tiddly_prompts` |
| Content MCP URL (local) | `http://localhost:8001/mcp` |
| Prompts MCP URL (local) | `http://localhost:8002/mcp` |
| API URL (local) | `http://localhost:8000` |
| Token name pattern (CLI-minted) | `cli-mcp-<tool>-<server>-<6hex>` |
| Test-harness token naming convention | `cli-mcp-test-*` (reserved for ad-hoc test PATs, safe to bulk-delete) |
| Token prefix | `bm_` |
| Dry-run placeholder | `<new-token-would-be-created>` |
| Backup timestamp format | `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ` (UTC) |

# Reference: tool × scope support

| Tool | user | directory |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| claude-desktop | yes | no |
| claude-code | yes | yes |
| codex | yes | yes |

Legacy scope values `local` and `project` are rejected at validation.

# Reference: skills extraction paths
