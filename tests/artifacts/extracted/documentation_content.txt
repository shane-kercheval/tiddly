Installation
FastAPI requires Python 3.8+
Install FastAPI
The first step is to install FastAPI. For the full installation with all optional dependencies:
pip install "fastapi[all]"
This will install FastAPI along with uvicorn (an ASGI server) and other useful dependencies.
Minimal Installation
If you prefer a minimal installation, you can install just FastAPI:
pip install fastapi
Then install uvicorn separately to run your application:
pip install "uvicorn[standard]"
Create Your First App
Create a file called main.py
with the following content:
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()
@app.get("/")
def read_root():
return {"Hello": "World"}
@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
Run the Server
Start the development server with:
uvicorn main:app --reload
The --reload
flag enables auto-reload during development.
Next Steps
Now that you have FastAPI installed, proceed to the Tutorial to learn how to build your first complete application.
Tip: Check the API Reference for detailed documentation of all features.
