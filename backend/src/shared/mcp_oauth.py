"""
Shared OAuth protected-resource discovery and presence-only auth gating for the
MCP servers (the server side of the MCP authorization spec).

Three pieces, used identically by both MCP servers:

1. **Protected-resource metadata** (RFC 9728): each server advertises its own
   canonical MCP endpoint URL as the OAuth ``resource`` and points at Clerk as the
   authorization server, so an OAuth-capable client can discover where to sign in.
2. **A presence-only 401 gate**: a request to the MCP endpoint with no
   ``Authorization: Bearer`` header is rejected *before* MCP dispatch with a
   ``WWW-Authenticate`` pointer to the metadata (RFC 9728 §5.1) — the signal that
   triggers a client's OAuth bootstrap.
3. **CORS** (via Starlette's ``CORSMiddleware``): browser-based connectors make
   cross-origin calls to ``/mcp`` and the well-known routes; the middleware handles
   preflight and exposes ``WWW-Authenticate`` so browser JS can read the challenge.

**This module does NOT verify tokens.** The MCP servers stay proxies: a present
bearer (valid or not) flows through to the backend API, which remains the only
verifier. The gate is presence-only by design.

**Resource identity (RFC 9728 §3).** The ``resource`` MUST equal the URL clients
actually connect to — i.e. the full ``https://<host>/mcp`` endpoint, *including*
the path, not the bare origin. The metadata URL is formed by inserting the
well-known segment between host and path (``…/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp``),
so a naive ``resource_url + well_known`` concatenation would be wrong — see
:func:`build_oauth_config`.

Configuration is resolved and validated **once** into an immutable
:class:`OAuthConfig` (see :func:`build_oauth_config`); servers build it at startup
so a missing/malformed value crashes the process instead of serving a
healthy-but-broken OAuth endpoint to the first client.
