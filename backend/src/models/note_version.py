    NoteVersion model - schema for future version history.

    Not actively used yet. Designed for diff-based storage:
    - Every Nth save (e.g., 10) = full snapshot
    - In-between saves = diff only (using diff-match-patch library)
    - To reconstruct version X: find nearest prior snapshot, apply diffs forward

    Version semantics:
    - Note.content is always the live/current version
    - Note.version starts at 1 for new notes
    - Version 1 has NO NoteVersion row - the Note itself is version 1
    - When a note is saved: create NoteVersion row with diff, then update Note
