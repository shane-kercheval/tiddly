"""
Clerk webhook endpoint — the first inbound provider-calls-us surface.

Security posture: an unauthenticated webhook endpoint that deletes users is an
attacker-triggerable "delete this user" button, so the Svix signature is
verified on the RAW request body before anything is parsed or touched. There
is deliberately no Pydantic body model on the route — body parsing happens
only after verification succeeds. The body read itself is bounded (this is
the one unauthenticated body-reading route in the app, so it cannot rely on
auth rejecting oversized garbage first). If no signing secret is configured
the endpoint fails closed (503). Svix retries any non-2xx on a finite
schedule — see the delivery-failure runbook in README_DEPLOY.

Webhooks are sync convenience, never source of truth: JIT provisioning remains
the only creation path; this endpoint only handles `user.deleted` (and is the
natural future home for billing/org events). The dashboard subscription is
scoped to `user.deleted`, and the handler defensively no-ops anything else, so
broadening the subscription later needs a code change here, not a hotfix.
