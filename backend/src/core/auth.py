"""
Authentication module: IdP JWT verification (dual-accept) and PAT support.

Provider seam containment (architecture-level intent — keep it this way): every
provider-specific shape in the backend lives in this module plus its immediate
collaborators (`core/config.py`, `core/auth_cache.py`, `core/request_context.py`,
`schemas/cached_user.py`). Nothing outside the seam may parse tokens, read
provider claims, or know which IdP issued a credential.

Dual-accept window (Auth0 → Clerk migration, see
docs/implementation_plans/2026-07-02-clerk-migration.md): JWTs are routed by
their `iss` claim to the Auth0 or Clerk verifier; both resolve to the same user
rows (Auth0 tokens via users.auth0_id, Clerk tokens via users.external_auth_id).
The Auth0 path is removed at decommission (M6b).

    """
    Decode and validate a Clerk-issued JWT — session token OR OAuth access token.

    One verifier, two token kinds (the M4 parameterization of the M1 function,
    per the migration plan — deliberately not a third implementation). Both
    kinds share the instance's issuer and JWKS (confirmed empirically, ledger
    Q5), so signature/issuer/expiry/leeway verification is identical; only the
    post-verification claim rules differ, discriminated by the JWT header
    `typ`:

    - `typ: "JWT"` — session token (browser/native). Claims: `sub`, custom
      `email`/`email_verified`, `azp` on browser-origin tokens.
    - `typ: "at+jwt"` or `"application/at+jwt"` (both registered by RFC 9068
      §4) — OAuth access token (CLI M4, MCP M5). Claims: `sub` (same Clerk
      user id), `client_id`, `scope`; NO email, NO `azp`. The `client_id`
      must be present or the token is rejected.

    The header `typ` is a safe discriminator because the header is covered by
    the signature — it is read only after verification succeeds. Deliberately
    NOT discriminating on `azp` absence: that would quietly make the `azp`
    check optional across the board (the exact trap the plan's M4 step 1
    flags). Instead the `azp` rule below applies to BOTH kinds unchanged.

    `client_id` policy (decided at M4, recorded here per the security review):
    presence is required for `at+jwt`, but there is no client-id allowlist.
    Trust anchor: only OAuth apps on OUR Clerk instance can mint tokens our
    JWKS verifies, and creating such an app requires the instance secret key —
    an allowlist adds no barrier an attacker with that key couldn't clear, and
    a static list would break M5's dynamically-registered MCP clients. The
    client_id is logged for observability instead.

    Differences from the Auth0 path, per the migration plan's M1 (each verified
    against the live dev instance in the M0 spike):
    - No audience claim exists; the equivalent check is `azp` (authorized
      party) below.
    - `azp` rule: if present it must be in the configured allowlist; if absent
      it is tolerated. Browser-origin tokens carry `azp`; Backend-API-minted
      tokens carry none (M0 spike), and OAuth access tokens carry none (M4
      probe). Absence can't be forged onto a browser token — the token is
      signed — so present→check/absent→tolerate is safe regardless.
    - Explicit clock-skew leeway (~60s session tokens; see the constant's
      comment). Harmless for 24h OAuth tokens.

    Raises:
        HTTPException: If token is invalid, expired, has wrong issuer/azp, or
        is an OAuth access token missing `client_id`.
