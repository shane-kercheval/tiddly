"""
Concurrency tests for account deletion vs authentication (M8 review round).

These use `concurrent_session_factory` — fully independent connections and
REAL commits — because the races under test are cross-transaction by nature;
the shared-savepoint `db_session` fixture cannot express them. Each test
reproduces one exact interleaving deterministically by injecting the
deletion at the vulnerable instant via a patch, rather than hoping a sleep
lands in the window.

Cleanup: committed rows (users, deleted_identities) are removed in finally
blocks; Redis is flushed by the redis_client fixture teardown.
