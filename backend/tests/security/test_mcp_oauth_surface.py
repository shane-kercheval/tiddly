"""
Security review of the MCP servers' new unauthenticated HTTP surface (M5 OAuth).

The OAuth discovery metadata and the 401 challenge are the first new *unauthenticated*
HTTP surface on the MCP servers. These adversarial checks assert the surface is minimal
and can't be walked into tool dispatch, across BOTH servers (they share the mcp_oauth
module but are assembled differently — hand-built Starlette vs FastMCP http_app):

- the metadata discloses exactly the RFC 9728 spec fields and nothing else;
- ``/health`` and the well-known routes are the only public surface;
- an unauthenticated request to the MCP endpoint (or any subpath) is rejected with the
  401 discovery challenge before reaching dispatch — the challenge pointer is the only
  thing disclosed.

Token *verification* is the backend API's job (AD10) and is covered by the backend auth
suite; the MCP proxy deliberately does not verify, so it is not re-asserted here.
