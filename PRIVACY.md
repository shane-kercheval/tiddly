# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 20, 2024**

## Introduction

Tiddly ("we", "our", or "us") is operated by Shane Kercheval as an individual. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use tiddly.me (the "Service").

By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide
- **Account Information**: When you sign up via Auth0, we collect your email address and Auth0 user ID
- **Bookmark Data**: URLs, titles, descriptions, and page content you save
- **Tags and Lists**: Organization metadata you create
- **Personal Access Tokens**: API tokens you generate (stored hashed)

### Automatically Collected Information
- **Usage Data**: When bookmarks were created, updated, and last accessed
- **Authentication Data**: Login timestamps and session information (via Auth0)
- **Server Logs**: IP addresses, browser type, and access times (Railway infrastructure)

### Third-Party Content
When you save a bookmark, we automatically fetch and store:
- Page title and meta description
- Page content (up to 500KB) for search functionality

## How We Use Your Information

We use your data to:

## Data Storage and Security

### Where Your Data is Stored
- **Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on Railway (US servers)
- **Encryption at Rest**: Data is encrypted at storage level by Railway
- **Data Isolation**: Multi-tenant architecture ensures your data is separate from other users

### Important Security Notes
- We do **not** use end-to-end encryption because it would prevent search functionality
- The database administrator (Shane Kercheval) has technical ability to access data through database queries
- We will never access your data except when legally required or with your explicit permission
- See our FAQ for more details on data security
